72,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"Thank you, Mr. Chair."
73,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"Many of you may know Tonda Thompson, familiar face here."
74,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"She is always, she is the founder of the Harambee 5k walk run for healthy birth outcomes that partners with Brownsville Week every year."
75,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"She's worked here at the city before, but many of those in the viewing public may also know her from Rogue Dreams, her photography and videography business, as well as her, she swings wood, her carpentry business, I guess, that you would call it, and through Harambee 5k she does it with her non-profit."
76,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"I am grateful that she has chosen to build a home for those three things that are collective in the Harambee neighborhood and first in Burleigh, a neighborhood that means a lot to her."
77,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,She has taken a formerly city-owned building that was vacant for I believe 12 years and has chosen to renovate it for the utilization that she wants to have with it.
78,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,The Department of City Development has recommended this zoning change.
79,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I wholeheartedly support it and would hope that you all will as well.
80,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"With that, I'll turn it over to, I don't know who you want to talk first."
81,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So is the plan for this to be a mixed-use residential upstairs office on the first floor or all office?
82,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"I think you want to talk, Sam."
83,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Do you want me to?
84,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,This is a handsome building.
85,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I actually like the looks of this building.
86,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,It looks to be very original.
87,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I can give the substance of the zoning change request and then I know Ms. Thompson can talk about her business and why it's such a great fit both for the building and the neighborhood.
88,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,The zoning change.
89,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Just identify yourself.
90,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I'm sorry.
91,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Thank you.
92,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"Sam Likling, Department of City Development, City Planning Manager."
93,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"The request in front of the committee is to change the zoning from the current RT4 zoning, which is a residential zoning classification, to LB2 local business."
94,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,We believe that that zoning classification would both facilitate the reuse that all Roman Coggs already began to talk about.
95,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,You're going to hear a little bit more from Ms. Thompson in a moment.
96,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,It would also be consistent with the zoning of a lot of other corner establishments in Harambee and River West where you have that traditional neighborhood development pattern of having a mixed-use commercial establishment on an otherwise residential block.
97,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,The current zoning would not allow for commercial uses without various approvals by the Board of Zoning Appeals.
98,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"And the recommendation from DCD, which would be consistent with the Northeast Side Area Plan and a lot of other planning efforts around traditional urban development, would be to rezone it to LB2 to facilitate these uses both now and in the future."
99,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"This item was heard by our City Plan Commission at the Monday, July 18th meeting."
100,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"After hearing a presentation from the applicant, they wholeheartedly endorsed this change and spoke very positively about it."
101,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,The Common Council has also seen this proposal before.
102,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"This was a formerly city-owned building, and so the Council did approve the sale of the property to Ms. Thompson for the exact uses we're talking about today."
103,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"So, again, we think it's a really straightforward and positive zoning change that's consistent with the plan and the context, and it will facilitate a pretty incredible development that you're going to hear more about."
104,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Ms. Thompson?
105,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Yes.
106,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"First of all, thanks for all the work you have done for the City of Milwaukee, specifically, obviously, the Brownsville."
107,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"I mean, I think everyone is just very proud of the work that Alderman Cox has put into it over the years."
108,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"It's been a transformative, really, part of our city in the last 10 years, and we're grateful for women like you who are taking the leadership in that area."
109,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Would you just tell us a little bit about your project?
110,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"Thank you, thank you."
111,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"I also want to thank Alderman Cox for putting me on her shoulder as a beacon, helping me make a difference in the community."
112,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I couldn't do it without this Alderman here.
113,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Thank you.
114,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"Yes, my name is Tonda Thompson."
115,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I've done a lot of work in the community as a mentor to young people.
116,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I started a long time ago with Vogue Dreams Production.
117,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"After my modeling career, I started coaching young girls and teaching them how to walk with authority, as I call it, and having a confidence in teaching them modeling, basically, to be able to combat anything that they feel that they cannot do."
118,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"So this is a nine-year thing that has evolved into Valley Creative Collective, which is Vogue Dreams times 30."
119,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"As mentioned, She Slays Wood is a nationally known carpentry."
120,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,We were featured on the Kelly Carson Show.
121,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"A lot of people across the nation is, you know, ranting and raving about it, but the thing that makes me proud about She Slays Wood is that I have four young girls who are graduates of Bradley Tech, where I went to school, and they actually have the skills of a carpenter, and they can actually do the work that, you know, most men do as carpenters, and they would never have to beg anybody for a job, but any day of their lives."
122,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"And the Harambee 5k, of course, is near and dear to that neighborhood."
123,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"First of all, I'm from the Harambee neighborhood."
124,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"My family house is in the Harambee neighborhood, so to get a hold of this building, which was inspired by Audubon-McCox, to see this vision come true, it's a blessing to me because it's changing the community already."
125,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"Once our doors are open, whenever I'm there working on the building or trying to, you know, trying to figure out what's going on, what I want to do with the division, whenever the doors are open, people are flooding in, seeing how they can help make a difference within that building themselves."
126,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So that community is heavily invested into that project.
127,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"I've created lots of friends so far over the last year, cutting the grass outside, making sure the property stays somewhat feasible until we are able to do the work on the building."
128,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"So I'm just, it's just, I'm an honor to make that property a beacon to that neighborhood and to change the light of what's going on on Berlion Archives."
129,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"Mr. Chair, if you don't mind before she finishes, two things, if you can add, who some of the sponsors that have come along to assist are and also how the viewing public, if they want to know more information about Valor Collective, how they can learn that."
130,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Absolutely.
131,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"So we have support from Legacy Redevelopment Corporation, which is one of our our banks."
132,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,We also have support from Greater Milwaukee Foundation.
133,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"We also have support from American Family Insurance and a host of people and neighborhood people who've donated, who've, you know, when we first bought the building, I don't know if you guys ever seen the pictures of the building inside, but it was very scary."
134,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,It was very scary.
135,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And the neighborhood residents helped me come and clean out that building.
136,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,People donated dumpsters to help us clean up.
137,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"So it's just been a community, you know, a poor community support."
138,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"And there is still options to help if you like, but we have some big philanthropists coming through, helping us now and helping us get it done there."
139,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"In addition, Milwaukee Tools, Milwaukee Bucks."
140,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"What she says would, you know, it's a popular thing to see a woman, you know, use a hammer."
141,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So I have support from the Milwaukee Bucks who's donated as well as Milwaukee Tools have donated tools.
142,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"We have a huge support from a lot of different organizations across the city, but those are two of the main bigger ones that are coming on to help us."
143,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And the website?
144,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,The website is ValorCreativeCollective.com.
145,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,That gives you access to all of the businesses that are inside of that property that will be inside of that property once we're up and running.
146,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Could you repeat that please?
147,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,ValorCreativeCollective.com.
148,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And the word valor means to be brave in the sight of danger.
149,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And that's something I'm definitely doing right now.
150,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,But I don't think that neighborhood is danger.
151,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I just think that making a huge leap of change like that could be scary.
152,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And we're pushing through it.
153,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,That's great news.
154,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Alderman Baumann moves for approval.
155,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,It is a public hearing.
156,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So is there any other individuals who wish to testify in this matter?
157,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"If you want to just elaborate a little on the woodworking of this shop, tell us a little bit more about that."
158,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So right now my goal is to open up the windows to the shop.
159,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I was told that's prohibited.
160,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,You shouldn't do it.
161,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,But I want people to walk by and to be able to see young women working in a wood shop.
162,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And I want to just have that whole area just lit up.
163,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"But She Slangs Wood, we build tables, we build, right now we're building fences so we have occupancy to do so within our building."
164,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"So we're building fences, we're building sheds, she sheds, a lot of women like she sheds."
165,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So we come over as a group of women and we have a good time building sheds for other women and building fences for other women.
166,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So why did you start it?
167,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,I started it because I have a five-year-old son.
168,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,He was three at the time.
169,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,He stood on the table.
170,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,That's the story that we told on Kelly Carson Show.
171,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,My son broke the table.
172,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"It was the middle of the pandemic and we didn't have access of, you know, going to a furniture store."
173,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So I decided to start building the table myself.
174,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And I'm a videographer.
175,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,He wasn't receiving much work at the time.
176,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"We didn't know if we were going to live, to be honest, because it was right at the heart of the pandemic."
177,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So I just started selling tables to make extra ends meet.
178,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,And I realized that a lot of other women wanted to do the same.
179,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,"So I started teaching other women that art of building, but building whatever they wanted to, whenever they could."
180,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,This is fabulous.
181,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,That's great.
182,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,So I'm going to move for approval and hearing no objections to order.
183,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Thank you.
184,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Congratulations.
185,zoning changes,residential to business zoning change,Thank you.
186,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"Proceeding on the agenda, item six, file number 220299, a substitute resolution writing to minor modification to the detailed plan development known as Good Hope Industrial Center to allow additional fencing and other site changes at HellermannTyton facilities located at 6701 West Good Hope Road on the south side of Good Hope Road, West North 60th Street in the 9th Automatic District."
187,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,Sam?
188,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"Thank you, Chair Murphy."
189,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"Again, Sam Leikling, Department of City Development."
190,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,This file in front of you is a substitute resolution that would make some adjustments to the detailed plan development that the HellermannTyton facility is located within.
191,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,It was formerly known as the Good Hope Industrial Center when that detailed plan development was created.
192,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"Obviously, HellermannTyton is an anchor on the northwest side, providing large numbers of high quality jobs in the Granville area."
193,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,The item in front of you today is to make minor adjustments to the detailed plan development because this site is zoned detailed plan development.
194,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,The council does have purview over changes to the site and that it is controlled through the DPD zoning.
195,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,The changes that are being proposed today that you're going to hear from representatives from the company about momentarily are relatively minor changes to the fencing to increase both safety and circulation on the site as well as to add a guard shack.
196,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"The proposal was presented to our city plan commission on Monday, July 18th at our last city plan commission meeting."
197,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,Commissioners at the commission spoke about how attractive the existing HellermannTyton building is.
198,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,They supported these adjustments.
199,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"They did ask some questions to the team that I think you're going to hear them touch on a little bit about just how to make sure that that guard shack really blends in with the existing building, the high quality standards that HellermannTyton has throughout the site, and making sure that that is reflected in the proposal you're going to hear today and you're going to hear about that shortly from the applicant team."
200,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"After the public or after the hearing at city plan commission, the plan commissioners did unanimously recommend approval of this DPD amendment."
201,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,We're joined by Rick Rice from HellermannTyton as well as representatives of the design team to just talk in a little bit more depth about the proposal.
202,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,Go ahead gentlemen.
203,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,So what we're proposing is expanding the expanding the fencing around the site for security.
204,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,Currently there's a small corner on the northwest side of the property that isn't fenced in and houses the visitor parking and what we're proposing is expanding the fencing to include the visitor parking and add a guard shack to check people in as they come into the facility.
205,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"Along with that, expanding the fencing, they would be creating a drop-off lane to increase the safety for the employees that are are dropped off for each shift."
206,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,Very good.
207,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,Any questions or comments committee members?
208,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,"If not, Alderman Perez moves for approval."
209,zoning changes,Good Hope Industrial Center,Hearing no objections with my abstain on the vote and hearing no objections to order.

216,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,There's nothing final being presented today.
217,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,This would direct DCD to initiate a process to do two things.
218,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,One would be to update the housing component of the city-wide policy plan and also to recommend changes to the city the elements of the city's zoning code that regulate housing development.
219,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,The background there is obviously as you know back in 2010 the city-wide comprehensive plan including the policy city-wide policy plan was adopted.
220,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Since then we've had a number of area plan updates.
221,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,There's been a city-wide affordable housing plan.
222,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,There's been an you know the eco office has led a climate and equity plan in conjunction with the county and we've done transitory development planning.
223,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,"A lot of those plans have made recommendations related to adding density near transit, continuing to look at things like how we regulate parking, accessory dwelling units, things like that."
224,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,And so now we do want to take the next step in actually taking some of those recommendations and doing more in-depth look at our code.
225,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,"The good news is I think when you compare us to cities across the country we have a very we have the kind of zoning code that a lot of cities across the country are in some ways emulating as far as looking at a wider mix of uses, very progressive low parking requirements, elements of the code that guide additional density toward transit, and design guidelines that really influence and prioritize the experience in the pedestrian realm."
226,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,"That said we know that we can kind of continue to make the code as the code evolves, make changes that will advance some of the mayor's goals around growth, transit-oriented development, and some of the recommendations that have come out of our past planning studies around really making sure that our code enables that kind of development that I know the council's going on record wanting to see through your adoption of various comprehensive plans, the TOD plan, the work that's going on in the climate equity plan."
227,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,So we're proposing to during 2023 carry out a project to actually begin to bring back to you all recommendations on ways that we can adjust the code to further support and enable that type of development.
228,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,We do envision there being a fair amount of community engagement and outreach in this as that's a commitment we've made throughout any of our kind of planning exercises to work with you know stakeholders to ensure that the recommendations we're bringing forward align with you know neighborhood and community goals.
229,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,And we also the resolution in front of you in addition to directing us to carry out this project would allocate funding from our existing 2022 city advanced planning budget to allow us to support some of that committee outreach and also bring on a consultant that has some experience in graphically representing some of these types of things.
230,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,You know you've probably all seen the you know the in projects in the past you know really high quality graphics that are going to be needed to demonstrate to the public that kind of you know the kind of things we're talking about the kind of concepts.
231,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,The project would be fully managed by the DC planning staff.
232,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,We think we have a fair amount of in-house expertise in this but we still are asking for some funding to be allocated to supplement with those services I just talked about.
233,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,So that's the resolution in front of you and we obviously look forward to working with all the council members on this important project as it moves forward.
234,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Mr. Chair?
235,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,"Sure, Alderman Baumann."
236,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,You know I see this involves an expenditure of a hundred thousand dollars.
237,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Usually when we spend a hundred thousand dollars around here we're trying to fix something fix a problem you know all in favor of expanding our knowledge and these exercises are always worthwhile but a hundred thousand dollars for consultants.
238,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,What's the problem we're trying to fix with this expenditure?
239,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,I think that when you kind of zoom back out one of the mayor's when the mayor released his economic development vision one of the planks of that vision said that he wanted to look at the zoning code to make sure that there were not any barriers to the kind of growth and development that that is part of the administration's vision that is the type of thing that have been supported by past planning efforts.
240,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,So rather than and I think that will likely involve what what's impeding our growth and expansion.
241,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,I think when you look at some of the recommendations that came out of the transitory development study a few years ago there was certainly recommendations for looking at things like the height and density allowed on some of our commercial and transit corridors and maybe looking at you know again I don't envision there being like we're not proposing to throw out the code it's kind of looking at those areas that could perhaps be tweaked to better enable some of that type of development. I think that the things that have come up a number of times in past planning efforts that we want to give some further exploration to is exactly that is kind of how we how we regulate density along some of our some of our transit and commercial corridors whether or not there is justific whether or not we should be looking at some of the ways we require or don't require or regulate parking and new development especially around transit the degree to which accessory dwelling units and different people call those different things like to interrupt you know this sounds very benign but taken to its logical extreme I think people should understand what this can represent.
242,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,This could represent a significant up zoning of neighborhoods that have been traditionally very popular for their single and two-family residential character.
243,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Bayview is case in point if you if you rezone Bayview from an RT1234 to an RM13456 or 7 you could triple or quadruple the density of Bayview but would that be an improvement or would that be a detriment?
244,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,"Superior Street, South Shore Street, some of the most magnificent views in the city of Milwaukee are now in the possession of relatively modest single-family homes."
245,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,What would those streets look like with a row of 20-story high-rises?
246,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,And you would say well the neighbors would never sell.
247,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,"Oh no, developer comes in there willing to pay two million bucks for a house assessed at 400,000 and they might sell and you'd start to process because this happened in Chicago that's exactly how a lot of the Chicago lakefront developed or on the north side the northeast side Wall Avenue what a magnificent place for a string of high-rises or Terrace south of North Avenue what a big lots huge lots with lake views over the bluff magnificent location for high-rises"
248,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Are we really going to go there?
249,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Because if we really want to increase density and population growth you've got to add housing units where people want to live and it's those neighborhoods where people want to live.
250,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Is that a fair statement?
251,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,So yeah let me answer that question two ways first at the kind of macro level which I think you made a good statement there about we you know if we're going to be seeing the city grow and achieving some of the mayor's population goals we'll need to add housing units both where people want to live but across the city so I think that's a fair thing that we want to consider as we're carrying out this project in my opening comments I also said we're not bringing you final ideas or final final recommendations today so as far as like some of the very site-specific things you got into I don't pretend to come to you and say those because those are uniquely desirable residential neighborhoods because of their low density well and the thing I was going to mention the second point you know you you did you almost set us up too well to now make a plug that you know you talked about the Bayview neighborhood specifically and that is an area where we are doing detailed area planning right now led by Alderwoman Dimitrovich just tonight at from between 5 and 7 p.m. we have a meeting at South Shore Pavilion where we're going to present some initial recommendations for Bayview that have come out of the the planning process there so we are certainly looking at that and you know I've been we've certainly heard recommendations from residents in Bayview and I'm not going to pretend this has been unanimous but there's been a lot of people who said we do want to see growth in Bayview and we're certainly trying to accommodate that and and use that specific neighborhood planning process to plan for it so I think we're continuing to do the things we've always done which is plan you know both do neighborhood planning but also acknowledge the thing that you said at the start which is some of these issues when you look at regulatory tools and growth policy we do probably have to do some level of citywide analysis there so that's why we're proposing to undertake this project if you're right that depending on the way that this project unfolds like we certainly want input from the council and that's why we're proposing is a two-phase project where at the end of phase one we come back to you all at the council I presume that would come to ZND here and before we start actually writing you know writing code updates we say here are the general findings that we found here is the some general recommendations around things we want to that we want to advance and I think we'll ask the council this committee and then the council to go on record supporting that before we start right you said you know getting in the weeds of writing code because we don't want to bring you something that's not going to be able to get the support of this council additional questions Mr. Chair all the way yes please go ahead yes yes good afternoon Mr. Chair thank you and thanks for all the love for Bayview we love it and good looking out we are as Sam pointed out in almost a year and a half a very intense planning effort because we want to be part of the city solution we want to be in the driver's seat of our own future and we know we've had a lot of changes and so we are really working on a forward thinking vision how we can be more inclusive what that means what that looks and feels like and what changes need to happen and we've had some really interesting conversations in in Bayview that I'm happy to be part of that I don't think it's taken place at this level for a while however the question I had was kind of how you know how does this complement compare because I wouldn't want to support a citywide plan today that includes changes that I haven't finalized within my own district plan and I just wanted to understand that and we do have that meeting tonight where we're actually it's an open house we're going to first respond to the first draft that's that's what I'm interested in is I do believe we need a citywide plan but I mean where there's districts that are going through this intensive process I want to make sure that that's complemented and not contradicting Mr. Chair.
252,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,That's a great question all Roman and I think again I think we look forward to working with all alders as we kind of develop a more detailed scope for this project but as I've initially as we've initially thought about it I think you're right neighborhood planning will continue and neighborhood planning will likely continue kind of dictate you know key sites within individual neighborhoods and some of the you know neighborhood specific planning and how we implement those plans but there's a separate when I said the citywide aspect I also am talking I think about the overall city zoning code there are changes that we think we could be made to the code itself that are not neighborhood specific but that might help again enable some of the types of development that people have spoken about and again I don't want to like my goal today was not to get too far in any specific type of things because I know we don't I don't want to suggest that we've made final you know any kind of final conclusions but just an example that came up earlier was you know the the level of density that's currently allowed on some of our commercial corridors that that's regulated on a citywide basis through the code and there might be you know we as we've looked at in the in the past done TOD planning sorry I should stop using acronyms the transitory development planning one of the things that we've seen and we've also seen in some code administration that we've done is that perhaps you know making some kind of tweaks at the margins or turning the dials on some of those things in the code might better align with existing recommendations that have already been made in plans but have also been kind of you know are are very much citywide in nature and are not specific to one neighborhood or one site.
253,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Mr. Chair just uh I guess I want to be a little bit more direct but what if there's a conflict I mean um like we're really being careful in Bayview to not just say what we don't want but to to say what we do want and specifically where so um you know some of the areas that Alderman Bauman mentioned um are are ones that are being heavily considered for historical preservation our plan as you know is one that's um actually using funding and you should you would love this Alderman Bauman we're doing a bit of a modest of a survey of our historical analysis at the same time while we're planning and so my point is what if like what if the citywide plan says something that conflicts with our neighborhood plan?
254,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Right I think uh I think that's the kind of thing that we want to make sure we're being thoughtful about through the process and again like without um we do want to have more in-depth discussions with individual elders about that but I think that again at a high level one way to maybe think about that is that there's two aspects that govern you know what can you know the city's zoning and what can be done in development throughout the city and there's the zoning map which kind of talks about how individual properties are zoned and then there's also the code the text of the code and you know when we I don't anticipate that the citywide effort that we're talking about is going to get in depth about saying the zoning of site xyz should be changed it might instead say things like commercial corridors you know commercial corridors that are well served by transit and that are currently zoned you know for example our local business 2 district maybe there's tweaks that need to be made to that local business 2 district that will better enable transitory development but I don't anticipate it going in the weeds about any specific map amendments.
255,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,So my vote today is not actually changing any code right now.
256,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,No this is just the item that's in front of the committee today is to just initiate this process with much of the work taking place during 2023 in close partnership and close coordination with not just the elders on this committee but the elders that yeah and it would also allocate funding for us to begin the process.
257,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Okay all right thank you Mr. Chair appreciate it.
258,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,You're welcome.
259,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,Any additional questions or comments to committee members?
260,zoning changes,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements,"If not, Alderman Perez moves for adoption and hearing no objections so ordered."

319,zoning changes,property registration ,A resolution relating to a retroactive certificate of appropriateness for staining brick at 2422 North Sherman Boulevard in the Sherman Boulevard Historic District for David Griffin.
320,zoning changes,property registration ,And once again it's a public hearing for those wishing to provide oral testimony please let me know so.
321,zoning changes,property registration ,HVC Ms. Hatala you would like to begin or?
322,zoning changes,property registration ,Who would like to begin?
323,zoning changes,property registration ,I'll start.
324,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
325,zoning changes,property registration ,Ms. Hatala.
326,zoning changes,property registration ,Good afternoon members of the committee.
327,zoning changes,property registration ,My name is Karlyn Hatala and I'm one of the staff members to the Historic Preservation Commission.
328,zoning changes,property registration ,"This project came to us, came to the Historic Preservation Commission by way of citizen complaint that property owner was doing something to his property that was not appropriate and not in the preservation guidelines."
329,zoning changes,property registration ,Let's see.
330,zoning changes,property registration ,Come on.
331,zoning changes,property registration ,Let me try this.
332,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
333,zoning changes,property registration ,"The property owner is David Griffin and he has owned this house on Sherman Boulevard since June 15, 2020."
334,zoning changes,property registration ,"Brochures were mailed out to property owners in historic districts on about January 7, 2021."
335,zoning changes,property registration ,This brochure outlined the requirements for obtaining a certificate of appropriateness and also indicated that the person who receives this brochure is in a historic district and something to be celebrated.
336,zoning changes,property registration ,Oops.
337,zoning changes,property registration ,And this is the property at 2422 North Sherman Boulevard before.
338,zoning changes,property registration ,"It's a 1921 house designed by a prominent architect, Milwaukee architect called George Zogel."
339,zoning changes,property registration ,"He designed beautiful, very thoughtful interiors and exteriors during the bungalow era and his career extended past World War II."
340,zoning changes,property registration ,And this is a view of the house in its original state.
341,zoning changes,property registration ,And this is a view of the back of the house showing that there were portions of the house that were stucco clad and they were that creamy color and then the brick extended around the house.
342,zoning changes,property registration ,And this is sort of a close-up to show the texture of the brick.
343,zoning changes,property registration ,"And these are, let's see, bottom right is an inspector photo."
344,zoning changes,property registration ,The top left is either the complainant's photo or me after I took a quick drive by.
345,zoning changes,property registration ,"It's kind of a blue-tinted brown at this point and very monochromatic as opposed to what you saw before, which is a highly textured multicolor kind of buff brick."
346,zoning changes,property registration ,Can I say something?
347,zoning changes,property registration ,Sure.
348,zoning changes,property registration ,The texture of the brick in the book is still there.
349,zoning changes,property registration ,That didn't go nowhere.
350,zoning changes,property registration ,"It just said who you are, what's your name?"
351,zoning changes,property registration ,My name is David Griffin.
352,zoning changes,property registration ,I'm the house owner.
353,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
354,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yeah, that texture in the above is still there."
355,zoning changes,property registration ,It didn't take none of that away.
356,zoning changes,property registration ,Very good.
357,zoning changes,property registration ,Thank you.
358,zoning changes,property registration ,And it's a brown.
359,zoning changes,property registration ,It's a dark brown.
360,zoning changes,property registration ,It's not a blue.
361,zoning changes,property registration ,It's not a gray.
362,zoning changes,property registration ,Right.
363,zoning changes,property registration ,It's a brown.
364,zoning changes,property registration ,Okie doke.
365,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
366,zoning changes,property registration ,Continue.
367,zoning changes,property registration ,Here is our circa 1990 photo and another photo of the current state.
368,zoning changes,property registration ,This is Mr. Griffin's receipt and details for the kind of stain he applied to the house.
369,zoning changes,property registration ,The Historic Preservation Commission denied retroactive approval for this change of color because it is essentially irreversible.
370,zoning changes,property registration ,Discussion has been had about every possible alternative.
371,zoning changes,property registration ,"Multiple conservators were consulted by members of HPC, the commission members themselves, and the staff."
372,zoning changes,property registration ,"The only way to bring about any sort of restoration is to apply a mineral paint over it, which could bring the color closer to the original state."
373,zoning changes,property registration ,A prior owner who has been in contact with Ms. Hadula also suggested that even just painting the mortar joints could be a solution that would help address how monochromatic the home is now.
374,zoning changes,property registration ,"So staff's recommendation is to deny and let us pursue, at the very least, a test sample area with one of these mineral paints before dismissing this case entirely."
375,zoning changes,property registration ,"I do want to hear from the local person, Alderman."
376,zoning changes,property registration ,"This is Alderman Stamper's District, right?"
377,zoning changes,property registration ,I believe it is.
378,zoning changes,property registration ,Yes.
379,zoning changes,property registration ,"Alderman Stamper, do you have any comments?"
380,zoning changes,property registration ,"Well, what's left?"
381,zoning changes,property registration ,Is the owner able to speak?
382,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yeah, absolutely."
383,zoning changes,property registration ,Have you guys consulted about this possible testing for a different color?
384,zoning changes,property registration ,Yes.
385,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
386,zoning changes,property registration ,What was that conversation?
387,zoning changes,property registration ,"Well, the conversation was like, can we, in any way possible, take a color out of the old brick to match it up as close as possible?"
388,zoning changes,property registration ,"I said, yeah, it's possible."
389,zoning changes,property registration ,You can take one of the colors.
390,zoning changes,property registration ,"The original brick got maybe about three or four different colors in there, and you would have to probably paint one of those colors out of that brick to paint the house over again."
391,zoning changes,property registration ,But you can also put what this man suggested.
392,zoning changes,property registration ,"You can put that over that paint and introduce a different color into it, into the grain of the brick."
393,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
394,zoning changes,property registration ,"So, Mr. Griffin, do you live there?"
395,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yes, sir."
396,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
397,zoning changes,property registration ,All right.
398,zoning changes,property registration ,I would like to see them work it out.
399,zoning changes,property registration ,Can they work that out based on the recommendation of the Historic Preservation Committee?
400,zoning changes,property registration ,"Mr. Griffin, you're here to appeal the order, correct?"
401,zoning changes,property registration ,Pardon me?
402,zoning changes,property registration ,You're here to appeal the order?
403,zoning changes,property registration ,"Well, at first I was, but I'm willing to work, do whatever we've got to do to solve this problem, because really I didn't know, and I really don't want to be here in front of you guys if I knew this was going to happen, and I really don't."
404,zoning changes,property registration ,Right.
405,zoning changes,property registration ,"You know, I'm willing to go whatever works."
406,zoning changes,property registration ,I'll go with you guys.
407,zoning changes,property registration ,Let's figure this thing out.
408,zoning changes,property registration ,Get this over with.
409,zoning changes,property registration ,"Everything, Mr. Chair?"
410,zoning changes,property registration ,"Go ahead, Alderman Baumann."
411,zoning changes,property registration ,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to Alderman Stamper and members of the committee."
412,zoning changes,property registration ,"I mean, this is, the Historic Preservation Commission discussed this case at length at least twice, and it was our final judgment that there is no possible way we could issue a certificate of appropriateness in this case, because that would basically be saying that this is appropriate when it clearly isn't appropriate."
413,zoning changes,property registration ,"What complicates the case is that we're hearing from experts that said, well, there's nothing you can do about it."
414,zoning changes,property registration ,"Well, that even makes it worse to issue a COA, because once we issue a COA for full house painting of brick buildings, why would anyone else not do it and just go out and do it and not apply for the proper review?"
415,zoning changes,property registration ,"And if someone complained, there'd be a hearing, and they'd say, well, you gave it to this gentleman."
416,zoning changes,property registration ,We're entitled to the same after-the-fact approval as you got.
417,zoning changes,property registration ,And so basically your historic standards essentially are out the window for Sherman Boulevard.
418,zoning changes,property registration ,It's a practical matter.
419,zoning changes,property registration ,"Anyone can do anything they want, and they'll automatically get an appeal approved by the council."
420,zoning changes,property registration ,So why even bother at some point?
421,zoning changes,property registration ,There's no point in having historic preservation.
422,zoning changes,property registration ,"There's no point focusing on the great blocks of Grant Boulevard and Sherman Boulevard, because if you start granting everybody an exception because they're nice guys or you feel sorry for them, you might as well abolish historic preservation in those neighborhoods and everybody for himself."
423,zoning changes,property registration ,"So that's a policy call, and maybe that's what the neighborhood wants."
424,zoning changes,property registration ,"Maybe the neighborhood wants to abolish historic preservation on Grant Boulevard and Sherman Boulevard, and that's their right to make that point."
425,zoning changes,property registration ,That's the right of their local elected official to advance that argument.
426,zoning changes,property registration ,"I suspect there will be some neighbors who object to that, but that's why we have democracy."
427,zoning changes,property registration ,We cannot grant a COA for this unless you want the integrity of the historic review process completely destroyed.
428,zoning changes,property registration ,It's just that simple.
429,zoning changes,property registration ,I realize we're in a political environment.
430,zoning changes,property registration ,That's fine.
431,zoning changes,property registration ,"If that's the political choice, we live with it."
432,zoning changes,property registration ,But understand what you're doing.
433,zoning changes,property registration ,Fully understand the big-picture consequences of granting this appeal.
434,zoning changes,property registration ,"Now, if people want to work together and find a solution, great."
435,zoning changes,property registration ,Then we hold this and get a report back in September as to how it went.
436,zoning changes,property registration ,But I just wanted to put that out there so people understood it's not a matter of nice guys or we feel sorry for you or it's an excusable neglect situation.
437,zoning changes,property registration ,"What they did was arguably irreversible, and that puts this in a very unique category."
438,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yeah, I get that."
439,zoning changes,property registration ,But I can tell from Mr. Griffin there was no ill intent.
440,zoning changes,property registration ,He didn't know about it.
441,zoning changes,property registration ,He didn't know he was in a historic area.
442,zoning changes,property registration ,"So, I mean, in one aspect of it, it was done, I think, unintentionally, right?"
443,zoning changes,property registration ,"But now it can't be reversed because, as our experts say, it's pretty much done."
444,zoning changes,property registration ,"But you can try and mitigate it as much as possible, but it's not going to be a big change."
445,zoning changes,property registration ,"But I think it's appropriate to hold it, to give it a shot, and see what our options are to try and make a little bit less of it."
446,zoning changes,property registration ,"Do we not, as a city, notify when there's a sale transaction?"
447,zoning changes,property registration ,It's part of their deed.
448,zoning changes,property registration ,Is it part of the deed itself?
449,zoning changes,property registration ,The federal report will show that.
450,zoning changes,property registration ,It will show that.
451,zoning changes,property registration ,It is in the title report.
452,zoning changes,property registration ,"Unfortunately, Milwaukee County wants to charge us $800 a month to be able to even have access to the database to send out letters."
453,zoning changes,property registration ,So have we been doing that?
454,zoning changes,property registration ,No.
455,zoning changes,property registration ,So how would he know?
456,zoning changes,property registration ,Because it's in the deed.
457,zoning changes,property registration ,And we are sure and absolutely it was in his deed.
458,zoning changes,property registration ,Totally complete.
459,zoning changes,property registration ,"And we did mail out these pamphlets, and actually twice now."
460,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yeah, we sent it out again this year."
461,zoning changes,property registration ,"Starting last year after a long hiatus, we have mailed out this brochure to every owner in the city."
462,zoning changes,property registration ,"We frequently get this, Alderman Murphy."
463,zoning changes,property registration ,What's that?
464,zoning changes,property registration ,"We frequently get this situation when people buy a sheriff's sale where there's no title report and no title insurance, or land contract transactions where there's no title insurance."
465,zoning changes,property registration ,"So then they don't even know, yeah."
466,zoning changes,property registration ,"And what is the city supposed to do, go around and?"
467,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yeah, I mean, I understand."
468,zoning changes,property registration ,"Go ahead, Mr. Griffin."
469,zoning changes,property registration ,You had any further comments?
470,zoning changes,property registration ,Not at this time.
471,zoning changes,property registration ,I would like an opportunity to speak.
472,zoning changes,property registration ,Sure.
473,zoning changes,property registration ,What's your name?
474,zoning changes,property registration ,"My name is Charles Stewart, and I would like to respond to the complainant regarding this property."
475,zoning changes,property registration ,My family has been in the historic renovation and purchase of properties in Milwaukee and historic districts.
476,zoning changes,property registration ,Your question is on the microphone.
477,zoning changes,property registration ,"Oh, okay."
478,zoning changes,property registration ,My name is Charles Stewart.
479,zoning changes,property registration ,My family has been in the building and historical maintenance of properties that my grandfather built in the 1920s.
480,zoning changes,property registration ,This is a property that my grandfather built.
481,zoning changes,property registration ,He was a carpenter.
482,zoning changes,property registration ,My uncle was a mason.
483,zoning changes,property registration ,I personally purchased this property approximately 10 years ago so that it would be properly maintained and honored the quality of the building that he did.
484,zoning changes,property registration ,"Obviously, he found an excellent architect."
485,zoning changes,property registration ,The house is designed terrifically.
486,zoning changes,property registration ,"So I purchased the property, and Mr. Griffin has been employed by me for 15 years as a painter, almost exclusively on historic properties."
487,zoning changes,property registration ,I have owned properties in each of the historic districts in Milwaukee.
488,zoning changes,property registration ,"It's Wall Avenue and 3417 North Sherman and 2863 North Grant, and I picked up the pieces from the city and the federal government on these historic houses, got the certificates of appropriateness and all of the above, and I want to see this house partially repainted since there seems to be an objection."
489,zoning changes,property registration ,"I do own and I have developed properties interior-wise that are in historic districts, and as I say, Mr. Griffin was the one that did all of the work."
490,zoning changes,property registration ,He's also a carpenter.
491,zoning changes,property registration ,"So my impression of what's appropriate based on what my family built carpentry-wise, what my family did mason-wise, the architect they chose, this is not an attempt to start a revolution of people painting everything in appropriate colors."
492,zoning changes,property registration ,"I feel that there are properties that are in the gray spectrum of colors that have been approved for the other historic districts, one of which I used to own."
493,zoning changes,property registration ,"So I just want it understood that the legacy of the property is partially my family's, and that's why I sold it to Mr. David Griffin, because I wanted to make certain that it had the best of care and attention, and I did not want to sell it to a flipper or a dipper or anything else."
494,zoning changes,property registration ,I wanted to sell it to a resident of the neighborhood who will live there.
495,zoning changes,property registration ,"He has 10-year financing with me, and in 10 years it will be paid off and his family will have an asset in a great community."
496,zoning changes,property registration ,So that's it.
497,zoning changes,property registration ,"Okay, thank you."
498,zoning changes,property registration ,So you knew this was an historic district?
499,zoning changes,property registration ,I knew it was a historic property.
500,zoning changes,property registration ,"No, you knew this property was in an historic district?"
501,zoning changes,property registration ,That is correct.
502,zoning changes,property registration ,And you sold it to him on land contract?
503,zoning changes,property registration ,That is correct.
504,zoning changes,property registration ,"So there was no warranty deed conveyed from you to him, correct?"
505,zoning changes,property registration ,That is correct.
506,zoning changes,property registration ,So you knew it was in a historic district?
507,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yes, it was in the same district as Grant Boulevard and 3417 Sherman, 2863 Grant, which I also owned."
508,zoning changes,property registration ,And you didn't think it was relevant to tell him?
509,zoning changes,property registration ,"Apparently both the city and the federal government that I purchased each of these properties from, which took almost a year, they made me sign a statement that says there's no asbestos here, there's no lead here, when there were kids 2 years old, a 4-year-old Hispanic on 2863."
510,zoning changes,property registration ,What does that have to do with historic districts?
511,zoning changes,property registration ,It's got to do with the fact that I was lied to about the condition of these properties when I purchased them.
512,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yes, they were historic."
513,zoning changes,property registration ,Who lied to you?
514,zoning changes,property registration ,The city of Milwaukee.
515,zoning changes,property registration ,"If Tom Barrow was here, he'd say..."
516,zoning changes,property registration ,He'd say he was lied to?
517,zoning changes,property registration ,"No, he would say I had a conference, a press conference, on the porch of the house that I appropriately rehabbed and got a certificate of appropriateness for the central area unit outside."
518,zoning changes,property registration ,I know the law.
519,zoning changes,property registration ,So you've gone through the COE process on this property?
520,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yes, I have."
521,zoning changes,property registration ,"And it bothers me that somebody wants to get off track with a property owner who couldn't be more appropriate and is willing to change the color, essentially, back to a derivative of what it was."
522,zoning changes,property registration ,"If somebody in the neighborhood doesn't like the color, that's..."
523,zoning changes,property registration ,It's not a matter of liking the color.
524,zoning changes,property registration ,It's contrary to the design standards adopted by the Common Council when the historic district was created.
525,zoning changes,property registration ,It's not a matter of liking.
526,zoning changes,property registration ,We're changing it.
527,zoning changes,property registration ,We're not asking you to keep the color that you think is inappropriate.
528,zoning changes,property registration ,Thank you.
529,zoning changes,property registration ,That's what we're here for.
530,zoning changes,property registration ,Then we can get to the patches and the color and restore it so that might...
531,zoning changes,property registration ,"All right, so the motion is to hold it."
532,zoning changes,property registration ,So we're going to hold this item and see what we can do in terms of compromise and come back before the meeting.
533,zoning changes,property registration ,"Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair."
534,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yeah, thank you."
535,zoning changes,property registration ,"On the whole, does everybody know what we're facing here?"
536,zoning changes,property registration ,"So if we deny it, what happens?"
537,zoning changes,property registration ,"And if we hold it, are they going to come back with a historical preservation approval or something similar?"
538,zoning changes,property registration ,"I mean, I think the motion to hold it is to find out if there's any potential technical solution to assist in lessening the issue."
539,zoning changes,property registration ,"But his appeal still stands, and it would come back before the committee, but we would get a better feel of what that is."
540,zoning changes,property registration ,"But I guess to run the logic out, if the appeal is denied and he does not receive the certificate of appropriateness, what's the outcome of that?"
541,zoning changes,property registration ,What happens because it's painted?
542,zoning changes,property registration ,Right.
543,zoning changes,property registration ,What happens?
544,zoning changes,property registration ,What happens?
545,zoning changes,property registration ,"Eventually, DNS takes it to court."
546,zoning changes,property registration ,For what?
547,zoning changes,property registration ,For a fine?
548,zoning changes,property registration ,Yes.
549,zoning changes,property registration ,And is it a one-time fine?
550,zoning changes,property registration ,"Typically, until some sort of remedy is achieved."
551,zoning changes,property registration ,"But as you indicated, you can't change it."
552,zoning changes,property registration ,It's too late.
553,zoning changes,property registration ,"So that's not an acceptable solution, right?"
554,zoning changes,property registration ,Yes.
555,zoning changes,property registration ,"And, Mr. Chair, for the record, I would like to say that if this had just been the stucco, we wouldn't even be here."
556,zoning changes,property registration ,It's the brick.
557,zoning changes,property registration ,I get it.
558,zoning changes,property registration ,"But I mean, the logic is you're not going to find them if you can't fix it."
559,zoning changes,property registration ,"The court's going to say to you, the guy can't fix it."
560,zoning changes,property registration ,How does the court do that?
561,zoning changes,property registration ,Historic HPC.
562,zoning changes,property registration ,"Yeah, I get that, but I'm just running the logic out of it."
563,zoning changes,property registration ,Yeah.
564,zoning changes,property registration ,"I mean, there are mineral."
565,zoning changes,property registration ,Can we finish the logic?
566,zoning changes,property registration ,"Please, let's finish the logic."
567,zoning changes,property registration ,What happens?
568,zoning changes,property registration ,"I'm just saying that more than likely, if the appeal is not granted, DCE takes them to court."
569,zoning changes,property registration ,And it gets to court.
570,zoning changes,property registration ,And the court's going to do what they want to do.
571,zoning changes,property registration ,"But, I mean, usually in this case, it's like a fine."
572,zoning changes,property registration ,And you can increase that fine or have a monthly increase into the fine or it's a monthly fine.
573,zoning changes,property registration ,"But, I mean, the solution is to fix it."
574,zoning changes,property registration ,"And the court's going to ask, well, why can't you fix it?"
575,zoning changes,property registration ,"And the Housing Historical Preservation is going to say, you can't fix it."
576,zoning changes,property registration ,They're testifying today.
577,zoning changes,property registration ,You can't really fix it.
578,zoning changes,property registration ,So I'm just telling you that's reality.
579,zoning changes,property registration ,"We're all saying here that a mineral paint may be an option to lessen the effect, at least."
580,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
581,zoning changes,property registration ,So he's going to try and maybe do that.
582,zoning changes,property registration ,"Go ahead, sir."
583,zoning changes,property registration ,Yes.
584,zoning changes,property registration ,"I could, if they want to, we could paint the whole house or stain the whole house again to the color of one of the colors out of the original brick."
585,zoning changes,property registration ,That can be done.
586,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
587,zoning changes,property registration ,There's just no problem with that.
588,zoning changes,property registration ,This can be done.
589,zoning changes,property registration ,It's just we're sitting down at the table making a decision on what color we want to paint the house.
590,zoning changes,property registration ,"Well, that's why you reasoned the motion by Allman Stamper and Allman Bonds to hold it to try and get to that situation."
591,zoning changes,property registration ,So we're going to hold it.
592,zoning changes,property registration ,Right.
593,zoning changes,property registration ,And so we're just trying to find a solution.
594,zoning changes,property registration ,Okay.
595,zoning changes,property registration ,Thank you.
596,zoning changes,property registration ,Thank you.
597,zoning changes,property registration ,I hear no objection to that motion.
598,zoning changes,property registration ,It's held.
599,zoning changes,property registration ,"Okay, sir."
600,zoning changes,property registration ,Proceeding on the agenda.
601,zoning changes,property registration ,"Item 10, file number 211891."
602,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Excuse me, file 11, file number 220286, communication with Department of City Development, transmitting the 2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics."
603,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"I mean, I get what you're saying."
604,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,I get what you're saying.
605,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Yeah.
606,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"No, I figured you would."
607,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,You've been through this before.
608,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Charles Stewart.
609,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Okay.
610,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman."
611,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Laurie Letzko with the Department of City Development.
612,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"I'm here with my colleague, David Peat."
613,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,We're here for our Annual Tax Incremental Financing District Report for the year 2021.
614,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,And all expenditures and activity are through December 31st of 2021.
615,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, David Peat, to give you an overview of our TID portfolio."
616,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,David.
617,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Hi.
618,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"I'm Dave Peat, the Budget Manager for the Department of City Development."
619,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,What we have is our Annual Report that's always due by July 1st of every year.
620,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,It's an annual submission that we do.
621,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,We actually have to do it for the Department of Revenue now.
622,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Every year we submit just the numbers, but we try to supply you with an actual narrative and give you updates on what's actually going on more than just what the numbers are saying."
623,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,The 2021 TID audit was recently finished.
624,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,So that should be probably presented by the Comptroller's Office soon.
625,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,I don't know exactly when.
626,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,But that one's done.
627,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Our numbers are unaudited in this report.
628,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,It does not include any of the accruals or anything like that.
629,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,That would be done after the end of the year.
630,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"At the end of 2021, we had 60 open or active tax incremental districts."
631,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,It was consistent with the prior year.
632,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,The incremental property value generated from all our TID portfolio right now is about $2.2 billion.
633,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,It's approximately the same as it has been in the prior year.
634,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,And the value represents about 6.33% of the entire city's value.
635,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,We are limited to 12% of the entire city's value for TIDs.
636,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Our projections right now is the future project costs that we need to recover is almost $147 million, which includes the debt service, but it does not include the developer-financed TIDs."
637,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"So in 2021, we had several TIDs that were created as well as amended."
638,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,So I'm just going to give you a brief overview.
639,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Many of you have seen these before this committee, and the council has approved them."
640,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"So our first TID that was created in 2021 was TID 107, Chapel Gardens."
641,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,This project is an affordable housing redevelopment of a former convent and outbuilding that is owned by the Sisters of St. Francis on South Layton Boulevard at Greenfield Avenue.

646,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,It is a developer-financed TIF for a term of 20 years with a 4.75% interest rate.
647,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"This development is being led by the Sisters of St. Francis and General Capital Development, and it is slated to be completed by the end of this year."
648,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Mr. Chair, I'm just curious."
649,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,These are units just available to the public?
650,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Yes.
651,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Thank you.
652,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,You're welcome.

658,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"The city provided a $12.1 million TIF for a commitment of 1,210 new jobs by 2026."

660,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,There is an option for an additional $7.9 million of TIF.
661,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,If the company decides to expand the building and add another 790 jobs.

666,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"There were three underperforming affordable housing TIDs, and we were able to do an allocation amendment, meaning that we donated to three underperforming TIDs."
667,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Either there was no increment coming in or very little, and the likelihood of it being paid off within the 27 years that TIDs have to pay off was very unlikely."
668,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"So we made the decision to amend this TID for a little bit more than $312,000, and we paid off TID 58 at 20th and Walnut for almost $55,000."
669,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"We also paid off TID 65 at 20th and Brown for a little bit more than $16,500, and then we also paid off TID 66 at Metcalf Park for a little bit more than $241,000."
670,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"TID 70, 735 North Water Street, we amended this TID for the second time."
671,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"There were some emergency repairs that needed to be done on city-owned segments of our Riverwalk at Mason Street and Wisconsin Avenue, so we amended this TID for $250,000, and our Department of Public Works conducted those repairs last year, and they are complete."
672,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Another TID that was amended was TID 85, 6th and National."
673,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"This was the first amendment to this TID, and it was led by President Perez, then Alderman."
674,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"The TID was amended for $1.275 million, and there were a few things we amended the project plan for."
675,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"$900,000 for street improvements to address reckless driving along 6th Street and Mineral Streets."
676,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"There was $250,000 in new project costs for planning and engineering for the Walkers Point Streetcar Extension, $50,000 for bike amenities, and $75,000 for administration of the TID."
677,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"And here's just a map kind of showing 6th Street from Virginia down to National, and you can see it's very faint, but you'll see bump-outs, pedestrian high visibility crosswalks for pedestrians for a better pedestrian experience and to try to slow down traffic, and then from National down to Mineral Street."
678,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"It's our understanding the Department of Public Works have completed the design and engineering, and they will be going out for a bid for these improvements."
679,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Mr. Chair?
680,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Hold on a minute, President."
681,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Yeah, for the record, I believe that it's going all the way from Virginia to Washington."
682,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Okay.
683,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"And I believe you, but the report says Mineral, so it goes a little further south?"
684,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Just a block.
685,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Just a block?
686,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Okay.
687,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,As long as that works for you.
688,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,It's further north than National.
689,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Right, no, it goes to Virginia."
690,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Right, right, right, yeah."
691,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"No, as long as the improvements are within that half mile."
692,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,I just don't want anyone listening that it was different from what they were told.
693,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Okay, thank you."
694,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,And then normally we conduct a housing resolution.
695,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Actually, our budget office does."
696,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"The department gives a list of TIDs that are ready to close, and the last year's increment will be used in the next year's budget, so in this case it would be this year's budget, to pay for some of our housing programs and our Strong Neighborhood Hoods Plan."
697,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"So normally this resolution would have been passed in November, but instead it was passed early January, but it did allow for almost $458,000 for the 2022 budget, so those dollars are now in this year's budget for many of our Strong Neighborhood Hoods Plan programs."
698,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,Two TIDs were closed last year.
699,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"We dissolved TID 22, the Bear Line B, and TID 66, Metcalfe Park Homes."
700,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"And looking ahead for 2022 activity, many of these have already occurred, but I'll just quickly go through."
701,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"We closed three districts this year, TID 52, Sigma Aldridge, TID 58, 20th and Walnut, TID 65, 20th and Brown, and then paving and infrastructure."
702,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"When a TID has paid off all its project costs, we look at the TID and we provide a half-mile map to the Department of Public Works, and we amend the TID to provide public infrastructure improvements."
703,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,So already a lot of this has occurred.
704,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"TID 41, Time Warner Riverwalk, the last Z&D meeting, $5.5 million in public infrastructure was approved, as well as $1 million in housing."
705,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"TID 42, Midtown, TID 49, Cathedral Place, TID 54, Stadium Business Park, those were approved earlier this year."
706,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"Again, infrastructure dollars to address reckless driving and improve roads in these district foundries."
707,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"And then TID 70, 735 Northwater, you approved that at your last meeting."
708,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"And that, too, was for Riverwalk."
709,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"And TID 76, 27th and Howard, and TID 77, Hillerman-Titan, those TID maps are at the Department of Public Works, but those TIDs will also be amended in the near future to pay for public infrastructure."
710,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,"So just this year alone, over $14 million has been approved in public infrastructure dollars to address reckless driving throughout the city by using our TIDs."
711,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report,So that really concludes the report.
712,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,We have online the narratives and more in-depth on the financials of each of the districts.
713,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,And so David and I are here to answer any questions that the committee has.
714,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Thank you very much.
715,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,You're welcome.
716,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"A quick question for you is just in this year alone, have we had any underperforming districts?"
717,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"And if we have, have the other districts made up for their losses?"
718,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,And which ones are they?
719,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"I would say the only TID that is still not performing, but I believe we'll have an increment this year once we get the final numbers from the DOR in August, was Century City."
720,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"But if you remember, the council has approved nearly, I don't know how many amendments, maybe four."
721,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,And we have like $2 million worth of the $25 million left on the book.
722,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"So we're hoping that enough increment will be produced to pay down that $2 million, or else we'll look again to another TID to pay down the last $2 million of debt for the Century City TID."
723,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Other than that, our TID portfolio is very healthy, and we do not have any other."
724,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,What about ICON?
725,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Well, the ICON, the initial investment of $4 million, we're not quite there."
726,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"He still has a little bit of that left, but we're waiting for the developer to start with the development, and we will be meeting with him within the next couple weeks."
727,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,We're going to take another tour of the site.
728,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,He has not secured his financing to move the project forward.
729,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"So that was a loan, though."
730,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"The developer is supposed to be paying the loan back to the city, that $4 million."
731,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"We extended that through the council-approved extension, and I believe August 1st is that deadline."
732,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,So we will have to make another decision.
733,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,That's next week.
734,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Yeah, that's next week, correct."
735,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Yeah.
736,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Yeah.
737,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Payment due, I believe, September 1st."
738,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,September 1st.
739,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Yeah.
740,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Okay.
741,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,And what typically happens if it's not paid?
742,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Well, there's a couple things that could happen."
743,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"If he doesn't pay, we could look at, you know, foreclosure."
744,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"I mean, there's different scenarios."
745,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,We just haven't gotten there yet.
746,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"I mean, but we are aware."
747,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Go ahead.
748,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"No, I'm done."
749,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Well, can you keep not only this committee but the council very much attuned to what that scenario is and that we want to receive information on that?"
750,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Yes, we can."
751,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,I'll have the project manager do that once we get to that point.
752,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,All right.
753,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"So, Mr. Chair?"
754,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Yes.
755,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"So for anyone listening, is there a plan in neighborhoods per se to look at TIFs differently, to move the needle with development in neighborhoods that people should have on their radar or expect to see?"
756,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"I would say we look at our area plans, and in those plans there's catalytic projects."
757,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"And development is led by the private sector, as you well know."
758,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"So when we have somebody in the private sector approach the department, we look at the area plans as an indicator."
759,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"You know, is this something that the community wants to see move forward?"
760,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,We don't just look at TIF.
761,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,We look at all our programs to see what best fits and what meets the priorities of the administration and the council.
762,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"And historically it's been affordable housing, as you're well aware."
763,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,It could be infrastructure.
764,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,It could be historic preservation in some cases.
765,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Jobs are a big indicator.
766,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Or just the redevelopment of an important building within that commercial corridor.
767,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,So we work with the local aldermen to help guide us with that decision.
768,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Okay.
769,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,All right.
770,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"I think that's the conclusion of your report, correct?"
771,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Yes, it was just questions."
772,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,It's just a communication file.
773,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Right.
774,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Any additional questions, comments?"
775,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"If not, at this time, Ombudsman Baumann moves to receive and place some filing."
776,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Hearing no objections, so ordered."
777,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Thank you.
778,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Item 12 and 13 we're going to take together.
779,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,One is 21-1513 and 22-0316.
780,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,They're communications to the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission relating to the 2020 annual and 2021 annual report.
781,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,"Good afternoon, Chair, members of the committee."
782,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,Thanks for having me.
783,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,questions,You're welcome.
784,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,So I'm before you to just briefly discuss the 2020 and the 2021 annual report from the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.
785,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"They were attached to the files, but I also have a very brief presentation just touching on highlights from the two years combined."
786,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"And, of course, happy to take questions as the Chair determines is appropriate."
787,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,I think everyone here is familiar with the Regional Planning Commission.
788,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"So just very briefly, this is the region we serve."
789,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Seven counties, 147 cities, villages, and towns, about 2 million people, and 1.3 million jobs in Southeastern Wisconsin."
790,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"It is about a third of the state's population, wealth, and land."
791,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Sorry, population, jobs, and wealth, but only about 5% of the state's land."
792,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"At the Regional Planning Commission, our role is enabled by state statutes which provide advisory area-wide planning specifically for public infrastructure and development of the region."
793,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"And in addition, we are the Metropolitan Planning Organization for Southeastern Wisconsin for the five urbanized areas."
794,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,That's a federal transportation role that is also largely advisory but does have a little bit more teeth to it than state statutes in that projects cannot move forward with federal funds unless they are in the Long-Range Transportation Plan and our Short-Range Transportation Improvement Program.
795,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"So sticking to the recent highlights, and council committees actually received updates on a number of these efforts as we were going along, but we did complete the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the region."
796,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,That is an every-five-year effort that we do in partnership with M7.
797,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Specific to that effort, the purpose of it, in addition to doing exactly what it says, setting the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the region, is to make parts of the region eligible for Economic Development Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration grants throughout any distressed area in the region."
798,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Those distressed areas do change every year, but they are essentially based on having higher unemployment rates or higher poverty rates."
799,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"So that effort does keep the region and many parts of the city of Milwaukee eligible for those EDA grants, which I know city staff are hard at work at pursuing."
800,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,Another thing that was completed during the past two years is an update to Vision 2050.
801,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,This is the Long-Range Land Use and Transportation Plan for the region.
802,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Alderman Baumann is on the Regional Transportation Plan Advisory Committee, so he's very familiar with this effort."
803,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Very high-level, this plan essentially encourages reinvesting in urban cores across the region, the largest, of course, being the city of Milwaukee, protecting areas with high environmental value, which the Commission has recommended for a number of years and actually this region has been particularly exceptional at accomplishing, building a variety of housing types and price points, and in particular trying to make sure that housing in some parts of the region is better aligned with the type of jobs that are in those locations across the region, mitigating congestion and investing in roadways to improve condition, and near and dear to my heart, expanding access to jobs, education, health care, and other needs via transit, biking, and walking."
804,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"There's a recommendation in the plan for a more than doubling in transit investment across the region, which obviously requires quite a bit of assistance from the state that thus far the region has been unable to obtain."
805,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Two big regional efforts we're working on right now, this one does apply to the city of Milwaukee, but perhaps less applicable in some ways, but I did want to touch on it anyways."
806,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"The Regional Chloride Impact Study, this is all about salt, so we're looking at the impact of and the sources of salt in the region's lakes, rivers, and streams, and in particular the reason we're looking at this, this was a request from Walworth County, the most rural county in the region."
807,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Obviously when you think about salt running off in the lakes, rivers, and streams, you think of road salt, but actually depending on where you are in the region, there may be many other things besides the road salt that is contributing to growing salinity in our lakes, rivers, and streams, and there is also not a process that removes salt once it is in, in particular, the lakes."
808,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Obviously it flows through the rivers and streams, but then it ends up in the lakes and it does stay in the lakes."
809,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"So the reason Walworth County was interested in this is Lake Geneva, the largest inland lake in the region, very deep lake, very large lake, but also has a very small watershed, and yet the salinity of Lake Geneva was increasing over time, and so they were trying to figure out with such a small watershed, why would salt runoff from the roads be causing such an increase in salt, and the answer in that area is actually water softeners."
810,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"And so what we're doing with this effort is looking at the watersheds across the region, trying to identify the proportional contribution, and then also identifying best practices, new technologies, recommendations that can be made to balance salt use with public safety, and quality of life concerns."
811,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Obviously the most common thing to do with the roads the city is doing, which is the brining process, increases the effectiveness of salt for a road to make sure to melt snow and ice, but it also reduces the amount of salt, so you're using less salt and doing it more effectively than just spraying rock salt after the storm occurs."
812,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Another regional effort that is underway, and this actually was a request from the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of City Development, Vanessa Koster, as well as also a request from a commissioner from Walworth County, we are doing our very first regional food system plan."
813,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"We haven't been directly involved in this in the past, but essentially the drivers for this effort are to look at healthy food access across the region, obviously a challenge in the lowest income parts of the region, which is the most urban parts of the region, and also the most rural parts of the region."
814,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,And so we have a challenge in both of those locations around healthy food access.
815,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"We also have a statewide challenge regarding the financial sustainability of family farms, and so we're working with a number of partners who have been in this area much longer than we have to try to figure out if there's a way that we can increase the financial sustainability of farming operations, the environmental sustainability of it, and also increase access to healthy foods in many parts of the region."
816,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"I did want to note some things that are a little bit more specific to the city, or at least the immediate area here."
817,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,So one effort that we did that was a bit of a branch out for us as a planning agency is FlexRide Milwaukee.
818,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"We worked with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and they in fact took the lead at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning there."
819,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,The Department of Urban Planning took the lead on applying for a National Science Foundation grant.
820,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"They succeeded in getting a million-dollar National Science Foundation grant, which is being used through the end of October to experiment with different flexible transit-type services to connect people to suburban jobs."
821,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,So the green zones and the yellow zones on the map there are the zones within the city.
822,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"People can use a smartphone app or dial a number, a phone number, to request a ride and take it out to family-sustaining jobs in Menomonee Falls and Butler."
823,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"The project team, there's a number of entities involved in this project, but the project team was successful in obtaining a workforce investment grant from the State Department of Workforce Development and WEDC, and so that service will be extended into other parts of the region and also further out."
824,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,So it won't end in October anymore.
825,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,It will run at least through December 2024.
826,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,So we're excited to at least do a little bit to try to increase access to those suburban jobs that haven't been accessible to people who don't have a car or don't wish to drive in the past.
827,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Also, an effort for Milwaukee County, but heavily impacting the city and involving the city and its residents, we are working through a north-south transit enhancement study running the length of 27th Street."
828,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,We have briefed the other persons whose districts this project would run through.
829,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Essentially, what we're working with the county on is taking a look at how to enhance the existing Purple Line to, again, increase speeds, make the service more desirable, and make it more useful for both its existing users and its future users."
830,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"As members of this committee and Alderman Baumann in particular know, we did look at a variety of potential paths for this enhanced transit service, including using the 30th Street Industrial Corridor, the actual rail corridor there."
831,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"There were a number of reasons that that was determined to not move forward, but where we are now is very close to having a recommendation that runs from Bayshore and Glendale along Silver Spring to the west until it reaches Tetonia, heading south on Tetonia until 27th Street starts, and then all the way south on 27th Street down to the Northwestern Mutual Franklin campus and the IKEA and the future developments in that area."
832,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,So that's the route that the county appears close to selecting.
833,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Next steps in this process would be to enter preliminary engineering and design, do the NEPA review, and then work to obtain a Federal Transit Administration grant for up to 80% of the cost of the project."
834,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,Right now we're estimating that's about a $150 million project from a capital cost perspective.
835,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics,delivering report 2,"Just briefly touching on other efforts, we continue to work with MMSD on flood modeling and floodplain mapping."
