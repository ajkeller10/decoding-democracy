75,42,"She's worked here at the city before, but many of those in the viewing public may also know her from Rogue Dreams, her photography and videography business, as well as her, she swings wood, her carpentry business, I guess, that you would call it, and through Harambee 5k she does it with her non-profit.",6,residential to business zoning change
76,42,"I am grateful that she has chosen to build a home for those three things that are collective in the Harambee neighborhood and first in Burleigh, a neighborhood that means a lot to her.",6,residential to business zoning change
77,42,She has taken a formerly city-owned building that was vacant for I believe 12 years and has chosen to renovate it for the utilization that she wants to have with it.,6,residential to business zoning change
78,42,The Department of City Development has recommended this zoning change.,6,residential to business zoning change
79,42,I wholeheartedly support it and would hope that you all will as well.,6,residential to business zoning change
80,42,"With that, I'll turn it over to, I don't know who you want to talk first.",6,residential to business zoning change
81,42,So is the plan for this to be a mixed-use residential upstairs office on the first floor or all office?,6,residential to business zoning change
82,42,"I think you want to talk, Sam.",6,residential to business zoning change
83,42,Do you want me to?,6,residential to business zoning change
84,42,This is a handsome building.,6,residential to business zoning change
85,42,I actually like the looks of this building.,6,residential to business zoning change
86,42,It looks to be very original.,6,residential to business zoning change
87,42,I can give the substance of the zoning change request and then I know Ms. Thompson can talk about her business and why it's such a great fit both for the building and the neighborhood.,6,residential to business zoning change
88,42,The zoning change.,6,residential to business zoning change
89,42,Just identify yourself.,6,residential to business zoning change
90,42,I'm sorry.,6,residential to business zoning change
91,42,Thank you.,6,residential to business zoning change
92,42,"Sam Likling, Department of City Development, City Planning Manager.",6,residential to business zoning change
93,42,"The request in front of the committee is to change the zoning from the current RT4 zoning, which is a residential zoning classification, to LB2 local business.",6,residential to business zoning change
94,42,We believe that that zoning classification would both facilitate the reuse that all Roman Coggs already began to talk about.,6,residential to business zoning change
95,42,You're going to hear a little bit more from Ms. Thompson in a moment.,6,residential to business zoning change
96,42,It would also be consistent with the zoning of a lot of other corner establishments in Harambee and River West where you have that traditional neighborhood development pattern of having a mixed-use commercial establishment on an otherwise residential block.,6,residential to business zoning change
97,42,The current zoning would not allow for commercial uses without various approvals by the Board of Zoning Appeals.,6,residential to business zoning change
98,42,"And the recommendation from DCD, which would be consistent with the Northeast Side Area Plan and a lot of other planning efforts around traditional urban development, would be to rezone it to LB2 to facilitate these uses both now and in the future.",6,residential to business zoning change
99,42,"This item was heard by our City Plan Commission at the Monday, July 18th meeting.",6,residential to business zoning change
100,42,"After hearing a presentation from the applicant, they wholeheartedly endorsed this change and spoke very positively about it.",6,residential to business zoning change
101,42,The Common Council has also seen this proposal before.,6,residential to business zoning change
102,42,"This was a formerly city-owned building, and so the Council did approve the sale of the property to Ms. Thompson for the exact uses we're talking about today.",6,residential to business zoning change
103,42,"So, again, we think it's a really straightforward and positive zoning change that's consistent with the plan and the context, and it will facilitate a pretty incredible development that you're going to hear more about.",6,residential to business zoning change
104,42,Ms. Thompson?,6,residential to business zoning change
105,42,Yes.,6,residential to business zoning change
106,42,"First of all, thanks for all the work you have done for the City of Milwaukee, specifically, obviously, the Brownsville.",6,residential to business zoning change
107,42,"I mean, I think everyone is just very proud of the work that Alderman Cox has put into it over the years.",6,residential to business zoning change
108,42,"It's been a transformative, really, part of our city in the last 10 years, and we're grateful for women like you who are taking the leadership in that area.",6,residential to business zoning change
109,42,Would you just tell us a little bit about your project?,6,residential to business zoning change
110,42,"Thank you, thank you.",6,residential to business zoning change
111,42,"I also want to thank Alderman Cox for putting me on her shoulder as a beacon, helping me make a difference in the community.",6,residential to business zoning change
112,42,I couldn't do it without this Alderman here.,6,residential to business zoning change
113,42,Thank you.,6,residential to business zoning change
114,42,"Yes, my name is Tonda Thompson.",6,residential to business zoning change
115,42,I've done a lot of work in the community as a mentor to young people.,6,residential to business zoning change
116,42,I started a long time ago with Vogue Dreams Production.,6,residential to business zoning change
117,42,"After my modeling career, I started coaching young girls and teaching them how to walk with authority, as I call it, and having a confidence in teaching them modeling, basically, to be able to combat anything that they feel that they cannot do.",6,residential to business zoning change
118,42,"So this is a nine-year thing that has evolved into Valley Creative Collective, which is Vogue Dreams times 30.",6,residential to business zoning change
119,42,"As mentioned, She Slays Wood is a nationally known carpentry.",6,residential to business zoning change
120,42,We were featured on the Kelly Carson Show.,6,residential to business zoning change
121,42,"A lot of people across the nation is, you know, ranting and raving about it, but the thing that makes me proud about She Slays Wood is that I have four young girls who are graduates of Bradley Tech, where I went to school, and they actually have the skills of a carpenter, and they can actually do the work that, you know, most men do as carpenters, and they would never have to beg anybody for a job, but any day of their lives.",6,residential to business zoning change
122,42,"And the Harambee 5k, of course, is near and dear to that neighborhood.",6,residential to business zoning change
123,42,"First of all, I'm from the Harambee neighborhood.",6,residential to business zoning change
124,42,"My family house is in the Harambee neighborhood, so to get a hold of this building, which was inspired by Audubon-McCox, to see this vision come true, it's a blessing to me because it's changing the community already.",6,residential to business zoning change
125,42,"Once our doors are open, whenever I'm there working on the building or trying to, you know, trying to figure out what's going on, what I want to do with the division, whenever the doors are open, people are flooding in, seeing how they can help make a difference within that building themselves.",6,residential to business zoning change
126,42,So that community is heavily invested into that project.,6,residential to business zoning change
127,42,"I've created lots of friends so far over the last year, cutting the grass outside, making sure the property stays somewhat feasible until we are able to do the work on the building.",6,residential to business zoning change
128,42,"So I'm just, it's just, I'm an honor to make that property a beacon to that neighborhood and to change the light of what's going on on Berlion Archives.",6,residential to business zoning change
129,42,"Mr. Chair, if you don't mind before she finishes, two things, if you can add, who some of the sponsors that have come along to assist are and also how the viewing public, if they want to know more information about Valor Collective, how they can learn that.",6,residential to business zoning change
130,42,Absolutely.,6,residential to business zoning change
131,42,"So we have support from Legacy Redevelopment Corporation, which is one of our our banks.",6,residential to business zoning change
132,42,We also have support from Greater Milwaukee Foundation.,6,residential to business zoning change
133,42,"We also have support from American Family Insurance and a host of people and neighborhood people who've donated, who've, you know, when we first bought the building, I don't know if you guys ever seen the pictures of the building inside, but it was very scary.",6,residential to business zoning change
134,42,It was very scary.,6,residential to business zoning change
135,42,And the neighborhood residents helped me come and clean out that building.,6,residential to business zoning change
136,42,People donated dumpsters to help us clean up.,6,residential to business zoning change
137,42,"So it's just been a community, you know, a poor community support.",6,residential to business zoning change
138,42,"And there is still options to help if you like, but we have some big philanthropists coming through, helping us now and helping us get it done there.",6,residential to business zoning change
139,42,"In addition, Milwaukee Tools, Milwaukee Bucks.",6,residential to business zoning change
140,42,"What she says would, you know, it's a popular thing to see a woman, you know, use a hammer.",6,residential to business zoning change
141,42,So I have support from the Milwaukee Bucks who's donated as well as Milwaukee Tools have donated tools.,6,residential to business zoning change
142,42,"We have a huge support from a lot of different organizations across the city, but those are two of the main bigger ones that are coming on to help us.",6,residential to business zoning change
143,42,And the website?,6,residential to business zoning change
144,42,The website is ValorCreativeCollective.com.,6,residential to business zoning change
145,42,That gives you access to all of the businesses that are inside of that property that will be inside of that property once we're up and running.,6,residential to business zoning change
146,42,Could you repeat that please?,6,residential to business zoning change
147,42,ValorCreativeCollective.com.,6,residential to business zoning change
148,42,And the word valor means to be brave in the sight of danger.,6,residential to business zoning change
149,42,And that's something I'm definitely doing right now.,6,residential to business zoning change
150,42,But I don't think that neighborhood is danger.,6,residential to business zoning change
151,42,I just think that making a huge leap of change like that could be scary.,6,residential to business zoning change
152,42,And we're pushing through it.,6,residential to business zoning change
153,42,That's great news.,6,residential to business zoning change
154,42,Alderman Baumann moves for approval.,6,residential to business zoning change
155,42,It is a public hearing.,6,residential to business zoning change
156,42,So is there any other individuals who wish to testify in this matter?,6,residential to business zoning change
157,42,"If you want to just elaborate a little on the woodworking of this shop, tell us a little bit more about that.",6,residential to business zoning change
158,42,So right now my goal is to open up the windows to the shop.,6,residential to business zoning change
159,42,I was told that's prohibited.,6,residential to business zoning change
160,42,You shouldn't do it.,6,residential to business zoning change
161,42,But I want people to walk by and to be able to see young women working in a wood shop.,6,residential to business zoning change
162,42,And I want to just have that whole area just lit up.,6,residential to business zoning change
163,42,"But She Slangs Wood, we build tables, we build, right now we're building fences so we have occupancy to do so within our building.",6,residential to business zoning change
164,42,"So we're building fences, we're building sheds, she sheds, a lot of women like she sheds.",6,residential to business zoning change
165,42,So we come over as a group of women and we have a good time building sheds for other women and building fences for other women.,6,residential to business zoning change
166,42,So why did you start it?,6,residential to business zoning change
167,42,I started it because I have a five-year-old son.,6,residential to business zoning change
168,42,He was three at the time.,6,residential to business zoning change
169,42,He stood on the table.,6,residential to business zoning change
170,42,That's the story that we told on Kelly Carson Show.,6,residential to business zoning change
171,42,My son broke the table.,6,residential to business zoning change
172,42,"It was the middle of the pandemic and we didn't have access of, you know, going to a furniture store.",6,residential to business zoning change
173,42,So I decided to start building the table myself.,6,residential to business zoning change
174,42,And I'm a videographer.,6,residential to business zoning change
175,42,He wasn't receiving much work at the time.,6,residential to business zoning change
176,42,"We didn't know if we were going to live, to be honest, because it was right at the heart of the pandemic.",6,residential to business zoning change
177,42,So I just started selling tables to make extra ends meet.,6,residential to business zoning change
178,42,And I realized that a lot of other women wanted to do the same.,6,residential to business zoning change
179,42,"So I started teaching other women that art of building, but building whatever they wanted to, whenever they could.",6,residential to business zoning change
180,42,This is fabulous.,6,residential to business zoning change
181,42,That's great.,6,residential to business zoning change
182,42,So I'm going to move for approval and hearing no objections to order.,6,residential to business zoning change
183,42,Thank you.,6,residential to business zoning change
184,42,Congratulations.,6,residential to business zoning change
185,42,Thank you.,6,residential to business zoning change

190,42,This file in front of you is a substitute resolution that would make some adjustments to the detailed plan development that the HellermannTyton facility is located within.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
191,42,It was formerly known as the Good Hope Industrial Center when that detailed plan development was created.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
192,42,"Obviously, HellermannTyton is an anchor on the northwest side, providing large numbers of high quality jobs in the Granville area.",7,Good Hope Industrial Center
193,42,The item in front of you today is to make minor adjustments to the detailed plan development because this site is zoned detailed plan development.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
194,42,The council does have purview over changes to the site and that it is controlled through the DPD zoning.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
195,42,The changes that are being proposed today that you're going to hear from representatives from the company about momentarily are relatively minor changes to the fencing to increase both safety and circulation on the site as well as to add a guard shack.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
196,42,"The proposal was presented to our city plan commission on Monday, July 18th at our last city plan commission meeting.",7,Good Hope Industrial Center

198,42,They supported these adjustments.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
199,42,"They did ask some questions to the team that I think you're going to hear them touch on a little bit about just how to make sure that that guard shack really blends in with the existing building, the high quality standards that HellermannTyton has throughout the site, and making sure that that is reflected in the proposal you're going to hear today and you're going to hear about that shortly from the applicant team.",7,Good Hope Industrial Center
200,42,"After the public or after the hearing at city plan commission, the plan commissioners did unanimously recommend approval of this DPD amendment.",7,Good Hope Industrial Center
201,42,We're joined by Rick Rice from HellermannTyton as well as representatives of the design team to just talk in a little bit more depth about the proposal.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
202,42,Go ahead gentlemen.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
203,42,So what we're proposing is expanding the expanding the fencing around the site for security.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
204,42,Currently there's a small corner on the northwest side of the property that isn't fenced in and houses the visitor parking and what we're proposing is expanding the fencing to include the visitor parking and add a guard shack to check people in as they come into the facility.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
205,42,"Along with that, expanding the fencing, they would be creating a drop-off lane to increase the safety for the employees that are are dropped off for each shift.",7,Good Hope Industrial Center
206,42,Very good.,7,Good Hope Industrial Center
207,42,Any questions or comments committee members?,7,Good Hope Industrial Center

212,42,Resolution directing the Department of City Development to develop an update to the housing element of the city-wide policy plan to include proposed updates to the portions of the city's zoning code that govern residential development and authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements advanced planning fund to a sub-account for the housing zone code update.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
213,42,This is sponsored by Alderman Baum and myself and Perez.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
214,42,Thank you chair and co-sponsors.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
215,42,The resolution in front of you would direct the Department of City Development to begin a process.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
216,42,There's nothing final being presented today.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
217,42,This would direct DCD to initiate a process to do two things.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
218,42,One would be to update the housing component of the city-wide policy plan and also to recommend changes to the city the elements of the city's zoning code that regulate housing development.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
219,42,The background there is obviously as you know back in 2010 the city-wide comprehensive plan including the policy city-wide policy plan was adopted.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
220,42,Since then we've had a number of area plan updates.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
221,42,There's been a city-wide affordable housing plan.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
222,42,There's been an you know the eco office has led a climate and equity plan in conjunction with the county and we've done transitory development planning.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
223,42,"A lot of those plans have made recommendations related to adding density near transit, continuing to look at things like how we regulate parking, accessory dwelling units, things like that.",8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
224,42,And so now we do want to take the next step in actually taking some of those recommendations and doing more in-depth look at our code.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
225,42,"The good news is I think when you compare us to cities across the country we have a very we have the kind of zoning code that a lot of cities across the country are in some ways emulating as far as looking at a wider mix of uses, very progressive low parking requirements, elements of the code that guide additional density toward transit, and design guidelines that really influence and prioritize the experience in the pedestrian realm.",8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
226,42,"That said we know that we can kind of continue to make the code as the code evolves, make changes that will advance some of the mayor's goals around growth, transit-oriented development, and some of the recommendations that have come out of our past planning studies around really making sure that our code enables that kind of development that I know the council's going on record wanting to see through your adoption of various comprehensive plans, the TOD plan, the work that's going on in the climate equity plan.",8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
227,42,So we're proposing to during 2023 carry out a project to actually begin to bring back to you all recommendations on ways that we can adjust the code to further support and enable that type of development.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
228,42,We do envision there being a fair amount of community engagement and outreach in this as that's a commitment we've made throughout any of our kind of planning exercises to work with you know stakeholders to ensure that the recommendations we're bringing forward align with you know neighborhood and community goals.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
229,42,And we also the resolution in front of you in addition to directing us to carry out this project would allocate funding from our existing 2022 city advanced planning budget to allow us to support some of that committee outreach and also bring on a consultant that has some experience in graphically representing some of these types of things.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
230,42,You know you've probably all seen the you know the in projects in the past you know really high quality graphics that are going to be needed to demonstrate to the public that kind of you know the kind of things we're talking about the kind of concepts.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
231,42,The project would be fully managed by the DC planning staff.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
232,42,We think we have a fair amount of in-house expertise in this but we still are asking for some funding to be allocated to supplement with those services I just talked about.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
233,42,So that's the resolution in front of you and we obviously look forward to working with all the council members on this important project as it moves forward.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
234,42,Mr. Chair?,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
235,42,"Sure, Alderman Baumann.",8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
236,42,You know I see this involves an expenditure of a hundred thousand dollars.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
237,42,Usually when we spend a hundred thousand dollars around here we're trying to fix something fix a problem you know all in favor of expanding our knowledge and these exercises are always worthwhile but a hundred thousand dollars for consultants.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
238,42,What's the problem we're trying to fix with this expenditure?,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
239,42,I think that when you kind of zoom back out one of the mayor's when the mayor released his economic development vision one of the planks of that vision said that he wanted to look at the zoning code to make sure that there were not any barriers to the kind of growth and development that that is part of the administration's vision that is the type of thing that have been supported by past planning efforts.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
240,42,So rather than and I think that will likely involve what what's impeding our growth and expansion.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
241,42,I think when you look at some of the recommendations that came out of the transitory development study a few years ago there was certainly recommendations for looking at things like the height and density allowed on some of our commercial and transit corridors and maybe looking at you know again I don't envision there being like we're not proposing to throw out the code it's kind of looking at those areas that could perhaps be tweaked to better enable some of that type of development. I think that the things that have come up a number of times in past planning efforts that we want to give some further exploration to is exactly that is kind of how we how we regulate density along some of our some of our transit and commercial corridors whether or not there is justific whether or not we should be looking at some of the ways we require or don't require or regulate parking and new development especially around transit the degree to which accessory dwelling units and different people call those different things like to interrupt you know this sounds very benign but taken to its logical extreme I think people should understand what this can represent.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
242,42,This could represent a significant up zoning of neighborhoods that have been traditionally very popular for their single and two-family residential character.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
243,42,Bayview is case in point if you if you rezone Bayview from an RT1234 to an RM13456 or 7 you could triple or quadruple the density of Bayview but would that be an improvement or would that be a detriment?,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
244,42,"Superior Street, South Shore Street, some of the most magnificent views in the city of Milwaukee are now in the possession of relatively modest single-family homes.",8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
245,42,What would those streets look like with a row of 20-story high-rises?,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
246,42,And you would say well the neighbors would never sell.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
247,42,"Oh no, developer comes in there willing to pay two million bucks for a house assessed at 400,000 and they might sell and you'd start to process because this happened in Chicago that's exactly how a lot of the Chicago lakefront developed or on the north side the northeast side Wall Avenue what a magnificent place for a string of high-rises or Terrace south of North Avenue what a big lots huge lots with lake views over the bluff magnificent location for high-rises",8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
248,42,Are we really going to go there?,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
249,42,Because if we really want to increase density and population growth you've got to add housing units where people want to live and it's those neighborhoods where people want to live.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
250,42,Is that a fair statement?,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
251,42,So yeah let me answer that question two ways first at the kind of macro level which I think you made a good statement there about we you know if we're going to be seeing the city grow and achieving some of the mayor's population goals we'll need to add housing units both where people want to live but across the city so I think that's a fair thing that we want to consider as we're carrying out this project in my opening comments I also said we're not bringing you final ideas or final final recommendations today so as far as like some of the very site-specific things you got into I don't pretend to come to you and say those because those are uniquely desirable residential neighborhoods because of their low density well and the thing I was going to mention the second point you know you you did you almost set us up too well to now make a plug that you know you talked about the Bayview neighborhood specifically and that is an area where we are doing detailed area planning right now led by Alderwoman Dimitrovich just tonight at from between 5 and 7 p.m. we have a meeting at South Shore Pavilion where we're going to present some initial recommendations for Bayview that have come out of the the planning process there so we are certainly looking at that and you know I've been we've certainly heard recommendations from residents in Bayview and I'm not going to pretend this has been unanimous but there's been a lot of people who said we do want to see growth in Bayview and we're certainly trying to accommodate that and and use that specific neighborhood planning process to plan for it so I think we're continuing to do the things we've always done which is plan you know both do neighborhood planning but also acknowledge the thing that you said at the start which is some of these issues when you look at regulatory tools and growth policy we do probably have to do some level of citywide analysis there so that's why we're proposing to undertake this project if you're right that depending on the way that this project unfolds like we certainly want input from the council and that's why we're proposing is a two-phase project where at the end of phase one we come back to you all at the council I presume that would come to ZND here and before we start actually writing you know writing code updates we say here are the general findings that we found here is the some general recommendations around things we want to that we want to advance and I think we'll ask the council this committee and then the council to go on record supporting that before we start right you said you know getting in the weeds of writing code because we don't want to bring you something that's not going to be able to get the support of this council additional questions Mr. Chair all the way yes please go ahead yes yes good afternoon Mr. Chair thank you and thanks for all the love for Bayview we love it and good looking out we are as Sam pointed out in almost a year and a half a very intense planning effort because we want to be part of the city solution we want to be in the driver's seat of our own future and we know we've had a lot of changes and so we are really working on a forward thinking vision how we can be more inclusive what that means what that looks and feels like and what changes need to happen and we've had some really interesting conversations in in Bayview that I'm happy to be part of that I don't think it's taken place at this level for a while however the question I had was kind of how you know how does this complement compare because I wouldn't want to support a citywide plan today that includes changes that I haven't finalized within my own district plan and I just wanted to understand that and we do have that meeting tonight where we're actually it's an open house we're going to first respond to the first draft that's that's what I'm interested in is I do believe we need a citywide plan but I mean where there's districts that are going through this intensive process I want to make sure that that's complemented and not contradicting Mr. Chair.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
252,42,That's a great question all Roman and I think again I think we look forward to working with all alders as we kind of develop a more detailed scope for this project but as I've initially as we've initially thought about it I think you're right neighborhood planning will continue and neighborhood planning will likely continue kind of dictate you know key sites within individual neighborhoods and some of the you know neighborhood specific planning and how we implement those plans but there's a separate when I said the citywide aspect I also am talking I think about the overall city zoning code there are changes that we think we could be made to the code itself that are not neighborhood specific but that might help again enable some of the types of development that people have spoken about and again I don't want to like my goal today was not to get too far in any specific type of things because I know we don't I don't want to suggest that we've made final you know any kind of final conclusions but just an example that came up earlier was you know the the level of density that's currently allowed on some of our commercial corridors that that's regulated on a citywide basis through the code and there might be you know we as we've looked at in the in the past done TOD planning sorry I should stop using acronyms the transitory development planning one of the things that we've seen and we've also seen in some code administration that we've done is that perhaps you know making some kind of tweaks at the margins or turning the dials on some of those things in the code might better align with existing recommendations that have already been made in plans but have also been kind of you know are are very much citywide in nature and are not specific to one neighborhood or one site.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
253,42,Mr. Chair just uh I guess I want to be a little bit more direct but what if there's a conflict I mean um like we're really being careful in Bayview to not just say what we don't want but to to say what we do want and specifically where so um you know some of the areas that Alderman Bauman mentioned um are are ones that are being heavily considered for historical preservation our plan as you know is one that's um actually using funding and you should you would love this Alderman Bauman we're doing a bit of a modest of a survey of our historical analysis at the same time while we're planning and so my point is what if like what if the citywide plan says something that conflicts with our neighborhood plan?,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
254,42,Right I think uh I think that's the kind of thing that we want to make sure we're being thoughtful about through the process and again like without um we do want to have more in-depth discussions with individual elders about that but I think that again at a high level one way to maybe think about that is that there's two aspects that govern you know what can you know the city's zoning and what can be done in development throughout the city and there's the zoning map which kind of talks about how individual properties are zoned and then there's also the code the text of the code and you know when we I don't anticipate that the citywide effort that we're talking about is going to get in depth about saying the zoning of site xyz should be changed it might instead say things like commercial corridors you know commercial corridors that are well served by transit and that are currently zoned you know for example our local business 2 district maybe there's tweaks that need to be made to that local business 2 district that will better enable transitory development but I don't anticipate it going in the weeds about any specific map amendments.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
255,42,So my vote today is not actually changing any code right now.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
256,42,No this is just the item that's in front of the committee today is to just initiate this process with much of the work taking place during 2023 in close partnership and close coordination with not just the elders on this committee but the elders that yeah and it would also allocate funding for us to begin the process.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
257,42,Okay all right thank you Mr. Chair appreciate it.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements
258,42,You're welcome.,8,authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements

391,42,But you can also put what this man suggested.,10,property registration 
392,42,"You can put that over that paint and introduce a different color into it, into the grain of the brick.",10,property registration 
393,42,Okay.,10,property registration 
394,42,"So, Mr. Griffin, do you live there?",10,property registration 
395,42,"Yes, sir.",10,property registration 
396,42,Okay.,10,property registration 
397,42,All right.,10,property registration 
398,42,I would like to see them work it out.,10,property registration 
399,42,Can they work that out based on the recommendation of the Historic Preservation Committee?,10,property registration 
400,42,"Mr. Griffin, you're here to appeal the order, correct?",10,property registration 
401,42,Pardon me?,10,property registration 
402,42,You're here to appeal the order?,10,property registration 
403,42,"Well, at first I was, but I'm willing to work, do whatever we've got to do to solve this problem, because really I didn't know, and I really don't want to be here in front of you guys if I knew this was going to happen, and I really don't.",10,property registration 
404,42,Right.,10,property registration 
405,42,"You know, I'm willing to go whatever works.",10,property registration 
406,42,I'll go with you guys.,10,property registration 
407,42,Let's figure this thing out.,10,property registration 
408,42,Get this over with.,10,property registration 
409,42,"Everything, Mr. Chair?",10,property registration 
410,42,"Go ahead, Alderman Baumann.",10,property registration 
411,42,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to Alderman Stamper and members of the committee.",10,property registration 
412,42,"I mean, this is, the Historic Preservation Commission discussed this case at length at least twice, and it was our final judgment that there is no possible way we could issue a certificate of appropriateness in this case, because that would basically be saying that this is appropriate when it clearly isn't appropriate.",10,property registration 
413,42,"What complicates the case is that we're hearing from experts that said, well, there's nothing you can do about it.",10,property registration 
414,42,"Well, that even makes it worse to issue a COA, because once we issue a COA for full house painting of brick buildings, why would anyone else not do it and just go out and do it and not apply for the proper review?",10,property registration 
415,42,"And if someone complained, there'd be a hearing, and they'd say, well, you gave it to this gentleman.",10,property registration 
416,42,We're entitled to the same after-the-fact approval as you got.,10,property registration 
417,42,And so basically your historic standards essentially are out the window for Sherman Boulevard.,10,property registration 
418,42,It's a practical matter.,10,property registration 
419,42,"Anyone can do anything they want, and they'll automatically get an appeal approved by the council.",10,property registration 
420,42,So why even bother at some point?,10,property registration 
421,42,There's no point in having historic preservation.,10,property registration 
422,42,"There's no point focusing on the great blocks of Grant Boulevard and Sherman Boulevard, because if you start granting everybody an exception because they're nice guys or you feel sorry for them, you might as well abolish historic preservation in those neighborhoods and everybody for himself.",10,property registration 
423,42,"So that's a policy call, and maybe that's what the neighborhood wants.",10,property registration 
424,42,"Maybe the neighborhood wants to abolish historic preservation on Grant Boulevard and Sherman Boulevard, and that's their right to make that point.",10,property registration 
425,42,That's the right of their local elected official to advance that argument.,10,property registration 
426,42,"I suspect there will be some neighbors who object to that, but that's why we have democracy.",10,property registration 
427,42,We cannot grant a COA for this unless you want the integrity of the historic review process completely destroyed.,10,property registration 
428,42,It's just that simple.,10,property registration 
429,42,I realize we're in a political environment.,10,property registration 
430,42,That's fine.,10,property registration 
431,42,"If that's the political choice, we live with it.",10,property registration 
432,42,But understand what you're doing.,10,property registration 
433,42,Fully understand the big-picture consequences of granting this appeal.,10,property registration 
434,42,"Now, if people want to work together and find a solution, great.",10,property registration 
435,42,Then we hold this and get a report back in September as to how it went.,10,property registration 
436,42,But I just wanted to put that out there so people understood it's not a matter of nice guys or we feel sorry for you or it's an excusable neglect situation.,10,property registration 
437,42,"What they did was arguably irreversible, and that puts this in a very unique category.",10,property registration 
438,42,"Yeah, I get that.",10,property registration 
439,42,But I can tell from Mr. Griffin there was no ill intent.,10,property registration 
440,42,He didn't know about it.,10,property registration 
441,42,He didn't know he was in a historic area.,10,property registration 
442,42,"So, I mean, in one aspect of it, it was done, I think, unintentionally, right?",10,property registration 
443,42,"But now it can't be reversed because, as our experts say, it's pretty much done.",10,property registration 
444,42,"But you can try and mitigate it as much as possible, but it's not going to be a big change.",10,property registration 
445,42,"But I think it's appropriate to hold it, to give it a shot, and see what our options are to try and make a little bit less of it.",10,property registration 
446,42,"Do we not, as a city, notify when there's a sale transaction?",10,property registration 
447,42,It's part of their deed.,10,property registration 
448,42,Is it part of the deed itself?,10,property registration 
449,42,The federal report will show that.,10,property registration 
450,42,It will show that.,10,property registration 
451,42,It is in the title report.,10,property registration 
452,42,"Unfortunately, Milwaukee County wants to charge us $800 a month to be able to even have access to the database to send out letters.",10,property registration 
453,42,So have we been doing that?,10,property registration 
454,42,No.,10,property registration 
455,42,So how would he know?,10,property registration 
456,42,Because it's in the deed.,10,property registration 
457,42,And we are sure and absolutely it was in his deed.,10,property registration 
458,42,Totally complete.,10,property registration 
459,42,"And we did mail out these pamphlets, and actually twice now.",10,property registration 
460,42,"Yeah, we sent it out again this year.",10,property registration 
461,42,"Starting last year after a long hiatus, we have mailed out this brochure to every owner in the city.",10,property registration 
462,42,"We frequently get this, Alderman Murphy.",10,property registration 
463,42,What's that?,10,property registration 
464,42,"We frequently get this situation when people buy a sheriff's sale where there's no title report and no title insurance, or land contract transactions where there's no title insurance.",10,property registration 
465,42,"So then they don't even know, yeah.",10,property registration 
466,42,"And what is the city supposed to do, go around and?",10,property registration 
467,42,"Yeah, I mean, I understand.",10,property registration 
468,42,"Go ahead, Mr. Griffin.",10,property registration 
469,42,You had any further comments?,10,property registration 
470,42,Not at this time.,10,property registration 
471,42,I would like an opportunity to speak.,10,property registration 
472,42,Sure.,10,property registration 
473,42,What's your name?,10,property registration 
474,42,"My name is Charles Stewart, and I would like to respond to the complainant regarding this property.",10,property registration 
475,42,My family has been in the historic renovation and purchase of properties in Milwaukee and historic districts.,10,property registration 
476,42,Your question is on the microphone.,10,property registration 
477,42,"Oh, okay.",10,property registration 
478,42,My name is Charles Stewart.,10,property registration 
479,42,My family has been in the building and historical maintenance of properties that my grandfather built in the 1920s.,10,property registration 
480,42,This is a property that my grandfather built.,10,property registration 
481,42,He was a carpenter.,10,property registration 
482,42,My uncle was a mason.,10,property registration 
483,42,I personally purchased this property approximately 10 years ago so that it would be properly maintained and honored the quality of the building that he did.,10,property registration 
484,42,"Obviously, he found an excellent architect.",10,property registration 
485,42,The house is designed terrifically.,10,property registration 
486,42,"So I purchased the property, and Mr. Griffin has been employed by me for 15 years as a painter, almost exclusively on historic properties.",10,property registration 
487,42,I have owned properties in each of the historic districts in Milwaukee.,10,property registration 
488,42,"It's Wall Avenue and 3417 North Sherman and 2863 North Grant, and I picked up the pieces from the city and the federal government on these historic houses, got the certificates of appropriateness and all of the above, and I want to see this house partially repainted since there seems to be an objection.",10,property registration 
489,42,"I do own and I have developed properties interior-wise that are in historic districts, and as I say, Mr. Griffin was the one that did all of the work.",10,property registration 
490,42,He's also a carpenter.,10,property registration 
491,42,"So my impression of what's appropriate based on what my family built carpentry-wise, what my family did mason-wise, the architect they chose, this is not an attempt to start a revolution of people painting everything in appropriate colors.",10,property registration 
492,42,"I feel that there are properties that are in the gray spectrum of colors that have been approved for the other historic districts, one of which I used to own.",10,property registration 
493,42,"So I just want it understood that the legacy of the property is partially my family's, and that's why I sold it to Mr. David Griffin, because I wanted to make certain that it had the best of care and attention, and I did not want to sell it to a flipper or a dipper or anything else.",10,property registration 
494,42,I wanted to sell it to a resident of the neighborhood who will live there.,10,property registration 
495,42,"He has 10-year financing with me, and in 10 years it will be paid off and his family will have an asset in a great community.",10,property registration 
496,42,So that's it.,10,property registration 
497,42,"Okay, thank you.",10,property registration 
498,42,So you knew this was an historic district?,10,property registration 
499,42,I knew it was a historic property.,10,property registration 
500,42,"No, you knew this property was in an historic district?",10,property registration 
501,42,That is correct.,10,property registration 
502,42,And you sold it to him on land contract?,10,property registration 
503,42,That is correct.,10,property registration 
504,42,"So there was no warranty deed conveyed from you to him, correct?",10,property registration 
505,42,That is correct.,10,property registration 
506,42,So you knew it was in a historic district?,10,property registration 
507,42,"Yes, it was in the same district as Grant Boulevard and 3417 Sherman, 2863 Grant, which I also owned.",10,property registration 
508,42,And you didn't think it was relevant to tell him?,10,property registration 
509,42,"Apparently both the city and the federal government that I purchased each of these properties from, which took almost a year, they made me sign a statement that says there's no asbestos here, there's no lead here, when there were kids 2 years old, a 4-year-old Hispanic on 2863.",10,property registration 
510,42,What does that have to do with historic districts?,10,property registration 
511,42,It's got to do with the fact that I was lied to about the condition of these properties when I purchased them.,10,property registration 
512,42,"Yes, they were historic.",10,property registration 
513,42,Who lied to you?,10,property registration 
514,42,The city of Milwaukee.,10,property registration 
515,42,"If Tom Barrow was here, he'd say...",10,property registration 
516,42,He'd say he was lied to?,10,property registration 
517,42,"No, he would say I had a conference, a press conference, on the porch of the house that I appropriately rehabbed and got a certificate of appropriateness for the central area unit outside.",10,property registration 
518,42,I know the law.,10,property registration 
519,42,So you've gone through the COE process on this property?,10,property registration 
520,42,"Yes, I have.",10,property registration 
521,42,"And it bothers me that somebody wants to get off track with a property owner who couldn't be more appropriate and is willing to change the color, essentially, back to a derivative of what it was.",10,property registration 
522,42,"If somebody in the neighborhood doesn't like the color, that's...",10,property registration 
523,42,It's not a matter of liking the color.,10,property registration 
524,42,It's contrary to the design standards adopted by the Common Council when the historic district was created.,10,property registration 
525,42,It's not a matter of liking.,10,property registration 
526,42,We're changing it.,10,property registration 
527,42,We're not asking you to keep the color that you think is inappropriate.,10,property registration 
528,42,Thank you.,10,property registration 
529,42,That's what we're here for.,10,property registration 
530,42,Then we can get to the patches and the color and restore it so that might...,10,property registration 
531,42,"All right, so the motion is to hold it.",10,property registration 
532,42,So we're going to hold this item and see what we can do in terms of compromise and come back before the meeting.,10,property registration 
533,42,"Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair.",10,property registration 
534,42,"Yeah, thank you.",10,property registration 
535,42,"On the whole, does everybody know what we're facing here?",10,property registration 
536,42,"So if we deny it, what happens?",10,property registration 
537,42,"And if we hold it, are they going to come back with a historical preservation approval or something similar?",10,property registration 
538,42,"I mean, I think the motion to hold it is to find out if there's any potential technical solution to assist in lessening the issue.",10,property registration 
539,42,"But his appeal still stands, and it would come back before the committee, but we would get a better feel of what that is.",10,property registration 
540,42,"But I guess to run the logic out, if the appeal is denied and he does not receive the certificate of appropriateness, what's the outcome of that?",10,property registration 
541,42,What happens because it's painted?,10,property registration 
542,42,Right.,10,property registration 
543,42,What happens?,10,property registration 
544,42,What happens?,10,property registration 
545,42,"Eventually, DNS takes it to court.",10,property registration 
546,42,For what?,10,property registration 
547,42,For a fine?,10,property registration 
548,42,Yes.,10,property registration 
549,42,And is it a one-time fine?,10,property registration 
550,42,"Typically, until some sort of remedy is achieved.",10,property registration 
551,42,"But as you indicated, you can't change it.",10,property registration 
552,42,It's too late.,10,property registration 
553,42,"So that's not an acceptable solution, right?",10,property registration 
554,42,Yes.,10,property registration 
555,42,"And, Mr. Chair, for the record, I would like to say that if this had just been the stucco, we wouldn't even be here.",10,property registration 
556,42,It's the brick.,10,property registration 
557,42,I get it.,10,property registration 
558,42,"But I mean, the logic is you're not going to find them if you can't fix it.",10,property registration 
559,42,"The court's going to say to you, the guy can't fix it.",10,property registration 
560,42,How does the court do that?,10,property registration 
561,42,Historic HPC.,10,property registration 
562,42,"Yeah, I get that, but I'm just running the logic out of it.",10,property registration 
563,42,Yeah.,10,property registration 
564,42,"I mean, there are mineral.",10,property registration 
565,42,Can we finish the logic?,10,property registration 
566,42,"Please, let's finish the logic.",10,property registration 
567,42,What happens?,10,property registration 
568,42,"I'm just saying that more than likely, if the appeal is not granted, DCE takes them to court.",10,property registration 
569,42,And it gets to court.,10,property registration 
570,42,And the court's going to do what they want to do.,10,property registration 
571,42,"But, I mean, usually in this case, it's like a fine.",10,property registration 
572,42,And you can increase that fine or have a monthly increase into the fine or it's a monthly fine.,10,property registration 
573,42,"But, I mean, the solution is to fix it.",10,property registration 
574,42,"And the court's going to ask, well, why can't you fix it?",10,property registration 
575,42,"And the Housing Historical Preservation is going to say, you can't fix it.",10,property registration 
576,42,They're testifying today.,10,property registration 
577,42,You can't really fix it.,10,property registration 
578,42,So I'm just telling you that's reality.,10,property registration 
579,42,"We're all saying here that a mineral paint may be an option to lessen the effect, at least.",10,property registration 
580,42,Okay.,10,property registration 
581,42,So he's going to try and maybe do that.,10,property registration 
582,42,"Go ahead, sir.",10,property registration 
583,42,Yes.,10,property registration 
584,42,"I could, if they want to, we could paint the whole house or stain the whole house again to the color of one of the colors out of the original brick.",10,property registration 
585,42,That can be done.,10,property registration 
586,42,Okay.,10,property registration 
587,42,There's just no problem with that.,10,property registration 
588,42,This can be done.,10,property registration 
589,42,It's just we're sitting down at the table making a decision on what color we want to paint the house.,10,property registration 
590,42,"Well, that's why you reasoned the motion by Allman Stamper and Allman Bonds to hold it to try and get to that situation.",10,property registration 
591,42,So we're going to hold it.,10,property registration 
592,42,Right.,10,property registration 
593,42,And so we're just trying to find a solution.,10,property registration 
594,42,Okay.,10,property registration 
595,42,Thank you.,10,property registration 
596,42,Thank you.,10,property registration 
597,42,I hear no objection to that motion.,10,property registration 
598,42,It's held.,10,property registration 
599,42,"Okay, sir.",10,property registration 
600,42,Proceeding on the agenda.,10,property registration 
601,42,"Item 10, file number 211891.",10,property registration 
602,42,"Excuse me, file 11, file number 220286, communication with Department of City Development, transmitting the 2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics.",11,delivering report
603,42,"I mean, I get what you're saying.",11,delivering report
604,42,I get what you're saying.,11,delivering report
605,42,Yeah.,11,delivering report
606,42,"No, I figured you would.",11,delivering report
607,42,You've been through this before.,11,delivering report
608,42,Charles Stewart.,11,delivering report
609,42,Okay.,11,delivering report
610,42,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.",11,delivering report
611,42,Laurie Letzko with the Department of City Development.,11,delivering report
612,42,"I'm here with my colleague, David Peat.",11,delivering report
613,42,We're here for our Annual Tax Incremental Financing District Report for the year 2021.,11,delivering report
614,42,And all expenditures and activity are through December 31st of 2021.,11,delivering report
615,42,"I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, David Peat, to give you an overview of our TID portfolio.",11,delivering report
616,42,David.,11,delivering report
617,42,Hi.,11,delivering report
618,42,"I'm Dave Peat, the Budget Manager for the Department of City Development.",11,delivering report
619,42,What we have is our Annual Report that's always due by July 1st of every year.,11,delivering report
620,42,It's an annual submission that we do.,11,delivering report
621,42,We actually have to do it for the Department of Revenue now.,11,delivering report
622,42,"Every year we submit just the numbers, but we try to supply you with an actual narrative and give you updates on what's actually going on more than just what the numbers are saying.",11,delivering report
623,42,The 2021 TID audit was recently finished.,11,delivering report
624,42,So that should be probably presented by the Comptroller's Office soon.,11,delivering report
625,42,I don't know exactly when.,11,delivering report
626,42,But that one's done.,11,delivering report
627,42,Our numbers are unaudited in this report.,11,delivering report
628,42,It does not include any of the accruals or anything like that.,11,delivering report
629,42,That would be done after the end of the year.,11,delivering report
630,42,"At the end of 2021, we had 60 open or active tax incremental districts.",11,delivering report
631,42,It was consistent with the prior year.,11,delivering report
632,42,The incremental property value generated from all our TID portfolio right now is about $2.2 billion.,11,delivering report
633,42,It's approximately the same as it has been in the prior year.,11,delivering report
634,42,And the value represents about 6.33% of the entire city's value.,11,delivering report
635,42,We are limited to 12% of the entire city's value for TIDs.,11,delivering report
636,42,"Our projections right now is the future project costs that we need to recover is almost $147 million, which includes the debt service, but it does not include the developer-financed TIDs.",11,delivering report
637,42,"So in 2021, we had several TIDs that were created as well as amended.",11,delivering report
638,42,So I'm just going to give you a brief overview.,11,delivering report
639,42,"Many of you have seen these before this committee, and the council has approved them.",11,delivering report
640,42,"So our first TID that was created in 2021 was TID 107, Chapel Gardens.",11,delivering report
641,42,This project is an affordable housing redevelopment of a former convent and outbuilding that is owned by the Sisters of St. Francis on South Layton Boulevard at Greenfield Avenue.,11,delivering report
642,42,It comprises of 43 total units.,11,delivering report
643,42,"Fifty-nine of the units are one- and two-bedroom units for the elderly, and then there were four three-bedroom units for families.",11,delivering report
644,42,"In total, it was a $16.2 million investment.",11,delivering report
645,42,"The city's TIF investment is $720,000, and again, it was followed by our affordable housing TIF policy.",11,delivering report
646,42,It is a developer-financed TIF for a term of 20 years with a 4.75% interest rate.,11,delivering report
647,42,"This development is being led by the Sisters of St. Francis and General Capital Development, and it is slated to be completed by the end of this year.",11,delivering report
648,42,"Mr. Chair, I'm just curious.",11,delivering report
649,42,These are units just available to the public?,11,delivering report
650,42,Yes.,11,delivering report
651,42,Thank you.,11,delivering report
652,42,You're welcome.,11,delivering report
653,42,"Another TID that was created in 2021 was TID 108, 5th and Michigan.",11,delivering report

655,42,It was purchased by Milwaukee Tool and is the home of Milwaukee Tool.,11,delivering report
656,42,It is located at 5th and Michigan on the west side of Milwaukee's downtown.,11,delivering report
657,42,It is a $30-plus million investment.,11,delivering report
658,42,"The city provided a $12.1 million TIF for a commitment of 1,210 new jobs by 2026.",11,delivering report
659,42,"There was a human resource agreement for this development, and as reported at not the most recent but a couple, maybe two cycles ago, their HR requirements are being met and exceeded in this case, 40% RPP and 25% SBE.",11,delivering report
660,42,There is an option for an additional $7.9 million of TIF.,11,delivering report
661,42,If the company decides to expand the building and add another 790 jobs.,11,delivering report
662,42,"For this development, we are paying $10,000 for a new job in the region.",11,delivering report
663,42,"Our first TID last year that was amended was Sigma Aldridge, TID 52.",11,delivering report
664,42,It was Amendment 1.,11,delivering report
665,42,"This TID was very close to its expiration date, so we decided to look at our portfolio.",11,delivering report
666,42,"There were three underperforming affordable housing TIDs, and we were able to do an allocation amendment, meaning that we donated to three underperforming TIDs.",11,delivering report
667,42,"Either there was no increment coming in or very little, and the likelihood of it being paid off within the 27 years that TIDs have to pay off was very unlikely.",11,delivering report
668,42,"So we made the decision to amend this TID for a little bit more than $312,000, and we paid off TID 58 at 20th and Walnut for almost $55,000.",11,delivering report
669,42,"We also paid off TID 65 at 20th and Brown for a little bit more than $16,500, and then we also paid off TID 66 at Metcalf Park for a little bit more than $241,000.",11,delivering report
670,42,"TID 70, 735 North Water Street, we amended this TID for the second time.",11,delivering report
671,42,"There were some emergency repairs that needed to be done on city-owned segments of our Riverwalk at Mason Street and Wisconsin Avenue, so we amended this TID for $250,000, and our Department of Public Works conducted those repairs last year, and they are complete.",11,delivering report
672,42,"Another TID that was amended was TID 85, 6th and National.",11,delivering report
673,42,"This was the first amendment to this TID, and it was led by President Perez, then Alderman.",11,delivering report
674,42,"The TID was amended for $1.275 million, and there were a few things we amended the project plan for.",11,delivering report
675,42,"$900,000 for street improvements to address reckless driving along 6th Street and Mineral Streets.",11,delivering report
676,42,"There was $250,000 in new project costs for planning and engineering for the Walkers Point Streetcar Extension, $50,000 for bike amenities, and $75,000 for administration of the TID.",11,delivering report
677,42,"And here's just a map kind of showing 6th Street from Virginia down to National, and you can see it's very faint, but you'll see bump-outs, pedestrian high visibility crosswalks for pedestrians for a better pedestrian experience and to try to slow down traffic, and then from National down to Mineral Street.",11,delivering report
678,42,"It's our understanding the Department of Public Works have completed the design and engineering, and they will be going out for a bid for these improvements.",11,delivering report
679,42,Mr. Chair?,11,delivering report
680,42,"Hold on a minute, President.",11,delivering report
681,42,"Yeah, for the record, I believe that it's going all the way from Virginia to Washington.",11,delivering report
682,42,Okay.,11,delivering report
683,42,"And I believe you, but the report says Mineral, so it goes a little further south?",11,delivering report
684,42,Just a block.,11,delivering report
685,42,Just a block?,11,delivering report
686,42,Okay.,11,delivering report
687,42,As long as that works for you.,11,delivering report
688,42,It's further north than National.,11,delivering report
689,42,"Right, no, it goes to Virginia.",11,delivering report
690,42,"Right, right, right, yeah.",11,delivering report
691,42,"No, as long as the improvements are within that half mile.",11,delivering report
692,42,I just don't want anyone listening that it was different from what they were told.,11,delivering report
693,42,"Okay, thank you.",11,delivering report
694,42,And then normally we conduct a housing resolution.,11,delivering report
695,42,"Actually, our budget office does.",11,delivering report
696,42,"The department gives a list of TIDs that are ready to close, and the last year's increment will be used in the next year's budget, so in this case it would be this year's budget, to pay for some of our housing programs and our Strong Neighborhood Hoods Plan.",11,delivering report
697,42,"So normally this resolution would have been passed in November, but instead it was passed early January, but it did allow for almost $458,000 for the 2022 budget, so those dollars are now in this year's budget for many of our Strong Neighborhood Hoods Plan programs.",11,delivering report
698,42,Two TIDs were closed last year.,11,delivering report
699,42,"We dissolved TID 22, the Bear Line B, and TID 66, Metcalfe Park Homes.",11,delivering report
700,42,"And looking ahead for 2022 activity, many of these have already occurred, but I'll just quickly go through.",11,delivering report
701,42,"We closed three districts this year, TID 52, Sigma Aldridge, TID 58, 20th and Walnut, TID 65, 20th and Brown, and then paving and infrastructure.",11,delivering report
702,42,"When a TID has paid off all its project costs, we look at the TID and we provide a half-mile map to the Department of Public Works, and we amend the TID to provide public infrastructure improvements.",11,delivering report
703,42,So already a lot of this has occurred.,11,delivering report
704,42,"TID 41, Time Warner Riverwalk, the last Z&D meeting, $5.5 million in public infrastructure was approved, as well as $1 million in housing.",11,delivering report
705,42,"TID 42, Midtown, TID 49, Cathedral Place, TID 54, Stadium Business Park, those were approved earlier this year.",11,delivering report
706,42,"Again, infrastructure dollars to address reckless driving and improve roads in these district foundries.",11,delivering report
707,42,"And then TID 70, 735 Northwater, you approved that at your last meeting.",11,delivering report
708,42,"And that, too, was for Riverwalk.",11,delivering report
709,42,"And TID 76, 27th and Howard, and TID 77, Hillerman-Titan, those TID maps are at the Department of Public Works, but those TIDs will also be amended in the near future to pay for public infrastructure.",11,delivering report
710,42,"So just this year alone, over $14 million has been approved in public infrastructure dollars to address reckless driving throughout the city by using our TIDs.",11,delivering report
711,42,So that really concludes the report.,11,delivering report
712,42,We have online the narratives and more in-depth on the financials of each of the districts.,12,questions
713,42,And so David and I are here to answer any questions that the committee has.,12,questions
714,42,Thank you very much.,12,questions
715,42,You're welcome.,12,questions
716,42,"A quick question for you is just in this year alone, have we had any underperforming districts?",12,questions
717,42,"And if we have, have the other districts made up for their losses?",12,questions
718,42,And which ones are they?,12,questions
719,42,"I would say the only TID that is still not performing, but I believe we'll have an increment this year once we get the final numbers from the DOR in August, was Century City.",12,questions
720,42,"But if you remember, the council has approved nearly, I don't know how many amendments, maybe four.",12,questions
721,42,And we have like $2 million worth of the $25 million left on the book.,12,questions
722,42,"So we're hoping that enough increment will be produced to pay down that $2 million, or else we'll look again to another TID to pay down the last $2 million of debt for the Century City TID.",12,questions
723,42,"Other than that, our TID portfolio is very healthy, and we do not have any other.",12,questions
724,42,What about ICON?,12,questions
725,42,"Well, the ICON, the initial investment of $4 million, we're not quite there.",12,questions
726,42,"He still has a little bit of that left, but we're waiting for the developer to start with the development, and we will be meeting with him within the next couple weeks.",12,questions
727,42,We're going to take another tour of the site.,12,questions
728,42,He has not secured his financing to move the project forward.,12,questions
729,42,"So that was a loan, though.",12,questions
730,42,"The developer is supposed to be paying the loan back to the city, that $4 million.",12,questions
731,42,"We extended that through the council-approved extension, and I believe August 1st is that deadline.",12,questions
732,42,So we will have to make another decision.,12,questions
733,42,That's next week.,12,questions
734,42,"Yeah, that's next week, correct.",12,questions
735,42,Yeah.,12,questions
736,42,Yeah.,12,questions
737,42,"Payment due, I believe, September 1st.",12,questions
738,42,September 1st.,12,questions
739,42,Yeah.,12,questions
740,42,Okay.,12,questions
741,42,And what typically happens if it's not paid?,12,questions
742,42,"Well, there's a couple things that could happen.",12,questions
743,42,"If he doesn't pay, we could look at, you know, foreclosure.",12,questions
744,42,"I mean, there's different scenarios.",12,questions
745,42,We just haven't gotten there yet.,12,questions
746,42,"I mean, but we are aware.",12,questions
747,42,Go ahead.,12,questions
748,42,"No, I'm done.",12,questions
749,42,"Well, can you keep not only this committee but the council very much attuned to what that scenario is and that we want to receive information on that?",12,questions
750,42,"Yes, we can.",12,questions
751,42,I'll have the project manager do that once we get to that point.,12,questions
752,42,All right.,12,questions
753,42,"So, Mr. Chair?",12,questions
754,42,Yes.,12,questions
755,42,"So for anyone listening, is there a plan in neighborhoods per se to look at TIFs differently, to move the needle with development in neighborhoods that people should have on their radar or expect to see?",12,questions
756,42,"I would say we look at our area plans, and in those plans there's catalytic projects.",12,questions
757,42,"And development is led by the private sector, as you well know.",12,questions
758,42,"So when we have somebody in the private sector approach the department, we look at the area plans as an indicator.",12,questions
759,42,"You know, is this something that the community wants to see move forward?",12,questions
760,42,We don't just look at TIF.,12,questions
761,42,We look at all our programs to see what best fits and what meets the priorities of the administration and the council.,12,questions
762,42,"And historically it's been affordable housing, as you're well aware.",12,questions
763,42,It could be infrastructure.,12,questions
764,42,It could be historic preservation in some cases.,12,questions
765,42,Jobs are a big indicator.,12,questions
766,42,Or just the redevelopment of an important building within that commercial corridor.,12,questions
767,42,So we work with the local aldermen to help guide us with that decision.,12,questions
768,42,Okay.,12,questions
769,42,All right.,12,questions
770,42,"I think that's the conclusion of your report, correct?",12,questions
771,42,"Yes, it was just questions.",12,questions
772,42,It's just a communication file.,12,questions
773,42,Right.,12,questions
774,42,"Any additional questions, comments?",12,questions
775,42,"If not, at this time, Ombudsman Baumann moves to receive and place some filing.",12,questions
776,42,"Hearing no objections, so ordered.",12,questions
777,42,Thank you.,12,questions
778,42,Item 12 and 13 we're going to take together.,12,questions
779,42,One is 21-1513 and 22-0316.,12,questions
780,42,They're communications to the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission relating to the 2020 annual and 2021 annual report.,12,questions
781,42,"Good afternoon, Chair, members of the committee.",12,questions
782,42,Thanks for having me.,12,questions
783,42,You're welcome.,12,questions
784,42,So I'm before you to just briefly discuss the 2020 and the 2021 annual report from the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.,13,delivering report 2
785,42,"They were attached to the files, but I also have a very brief presentation just touching on highlights from the two years combined.",13,delivering report 2
786,42,"And, of course, happy to take questions as the Chair determines is appropriate.",13,delivering report 2
787,42,I think everyone here is familiar with the Regional Planning Commission.,13,delivering report 2
788,42,"So just very briefly, this is the region we serve.",13,delivering report 2
789,42,"Seven counties, 147 cities, villages, and towns, about 2 million people, and 1.3 million jobs in Southeastern Wisconsin.",13,delivering report 2
790,42,"It is about a third of the state's population, wealth, and land.",13,delivering report 2
791,42,"Sorry, population, jobs, and wealth, but only about 5% of the state's land.",13,delivering report 2
792,42,"At the Regional Planning Commission, our role is enabled by state statutes which provide advisory area-wide planning specifically for public infrastructure and development of the region.",13,delivering report 2
793,42,"And in addition, we are the Metropolitan Planning Organization for Southeastern Wisconsin for the five urbanized areas.",13,delivering report 2
794,42,That's a federal transportation role that is also largely advisory but does have a little bit more teeth to it than state statutes in that projects cannot move forward with federal funds unless they are in the Long-Range Transportation Plan and our Short-Range Transportation Improvement Program.,13,delivering report 2
795,42,"So sticking to the recent highlights, and council committees actually received updates on a number of these efforts as we were going along, but we did complete the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the region.",13,delivering report 2
796,42,That is an every-five-year effort that we do in partnership with M7.,13,delivering report 2
797,42,"Specific to that effort, the purpose of it, in addition to doing exactly what it says, setting the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the region, is to make parts of the region eligible for Economic Development Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration grants throughout any distressed area in the region.",13,delivering report 2
798,42,"Those distressed areas do change every year, but they are essentially based on having higher unemployment rates or higher poverty rates.",13,delivering report 2
799,42,"So that effort does keep the region and many parts of the city of Milwaukee eligible for those EDA grants, which I know city staff are hard at work at pursuing.",13,delivering report 2
800,42,Another thing that was completed during the past two years is an update to Vision 2050.,13,delivering report 2
801,42,This is the Long-Range Land Use and Transportation Plan for the region.,13,delivering report 2
802,42,"Alderman Baumann is on the Regional Transportation Plan Advisory Committee, so he's very familiar with this effort.",13,delivering report 2
803,42,"Very high-level, this plan essentially encourages reinvesting in urban cores across the region, the largest, of course, being the city of Milwaukee, protecting areas with high environmental value, which the Commission has recommended for a number of years and actually this region has been particularly exceptional at accomplishing, building a variety of housing types and price points, and in particular trying to make sure that housing in some parts of the region is better aligned with the type of jobs that are in those locations across the region, mitigating congestion and investing in roadways to improve condition, and near and dear to my heart, expanding access to jobs, education, health care, and other needs via transit, biking, and walking.",13,delivering report 2
804,42,"There's a recommendation in the plan for a more than doubling in transit investment across the region, which obviously requires quite a bit of assistance from the state that thus far the region has been unable to obtain.",13,delivering report 2
805,42,"Two big regional efforts we're working on right now, this one does apply to the city of Milwaukee, but perhaps less applicable in some ways, but I did want to touch on it anyways.",13,delivering report 2
806,42,"The Regional Chloride Impact Study, this is all about salt, so we're looking at the impact of and the sources of salt in the region's lakes, rivers, and streams, and in particular the reason we're looking at this, this was a request from Walworth County, the most rural county in the region.",13,delivering report 2
807,42,"Obviously when you think about salt running off in the lakes, rivers, and streams, you think of road salt, but actually depending on where you are in the region, there may be many other things besides the road salt that is contributing to growing salinity in our lakes, rivers, and streams, and there is also not a process that removes salt once it is in, in particular, the lakes.",13,delivering report 2
808,42,"Obviously it flows through the rivers and streams, but then it ends up in the lakes and it does stay in the lakes.",13,delivering report 2
809,42,"So the reason Walworth County was interested in this is Lake Geneva, the largest inland lake in the region, very deep lake, very large lake, but also has a very small watershed, and yet the salinity of Lake Geneva was increasing over time, and so they were trying to figure out with such a small watershed, why would salt runoff from the roads be causing such an increase in salt, and the answer in that area is actually water softeners.",13,delivering report 2
810,42,"And so what we're doing with this effort is looking at the watersheds across the region, trying to identify the proportional contribution, and then also identifying best practices, new technologies, recommendations that can be made to balance salt use with public safety, and quality of life concerns.",13,delivering report 2
811,42,"Obviously the most common thing to do with the roads the city is doing, which is the brining process, increases the effectiveness of salt for a road to make sure to melt snow and ice, but it also reduces the amount of salt, so you're using less salt and doing it more effectively than just spraying rock salt after the storm occurs.",13,delivering report 2
812,42,"Another regional effort that is underway, and this actually was a request from the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of City Development, Vanessa Koster, as well as also a request from a commissioner from Walworth County, we are doing our very first regional food system plan.",13,delivering report 2
813,42,"We haven't been directly involved in this in the past, but essentially the drivers for this effort are to look at healthy food access across the region, obviously a challenge in the lowest income parts of the region, which is the most urban parts of the region, and also the most rural parts of the region.",13,delivering report 2
814,42,And so we have a challenge in both of those locations around healthy food access.,13,delivering report 2
815,42,"We also have a statewide challenge regarding the financial sustainability of family farms, and so we're working with a number of partners who have been in this area much longer than we have to try to figure out if there's a way that we can increase the financial sustainability of farming operations, the environmental sustainability of it, and also increase access to healthy foods in many parts of the region.",13,delivering report 2
816,42,"I did want to note some things that are a little bit more specific to the city, or at least the immediate area here.",13,delivering report 2
817,42,So one effort that we did that was a bit of a branch out for us as a planning agency is FlexRide Milwaukee.,13,delivering report 2
818,42,"We worked with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and they in fact took the lead at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning there.",13,delivering report 2
819,42,The Department of Urban Planning took the lead on applying for a National Science Foundation grant.,13,delivering report 2
820,42,"They succeeded in getting a million-dollar National Science Foundation grant, which is being used through the end of October to experiment with different flexible transit-type services to connect people to suburban jobs.",13,delivering report 2
821,42,So the green zones and the yellow zones on the map there are the zones within the city.,13,delivering report 2
822,42,"People can use a smartphone app or dial a number, a phone number, to request a ride and take it out to family-sustaining jobs in Menomonee Falls and Butler.",13,delivering report 2
823,42,"The project team, there's a number of entities involved in this project, but the project team was successful in obtaining a workforce investment grant from the State Department of Workforce Development and WEDC, and so that service will be extended into other parts of the region and also further out.",13,delivering report 2
824,42,So it won't end in October anymore.,13,delivering report 2
825,42,It will run at least through December 2024.,13,delivering report 2
826,42,So we're excited to at least do a little bit to try to increase access to those suburban jobs that haven't been accessible to people who don't have a car or don't wish to drive in the past.,13,delivering report 2
827,42,"Also, an effort for Milwaukee County, but heavily impacting the city and involving the city and its residents, we are working through a north-south transit enhancement study running the length of 27th Street.",13,delivering report 2
828,42,We have briefed the other persons whose districts this project would run through.,13,delivering report 2
829,42,"Essentially, what we're working with the county on is taking a look at how to enhance the existing Purple Line to, again, increase speeds, make the service more desirable, and make it more useful for both its existing users and its future users.",13,delivering report 2
830,42,"As members of this committee and Alderman Baumann in particular know, we did look at a variety of potential paths for this enhanced transit service, including using the 30th Street Industrial Corridor, the actual rail corridor there.",13,delivering report 2
831,42,"There were a number of reasons that that was determined to not move forward, but where we are now is very close to having a recommendation that runs from Bayshore and Glendale along Silver Spring to the west until it reaches Tetonia, heading south on Tetonia until 27th Street starts, and then all the way south on 27th Street down to the Northwestern Mutual Franklin campus and the IKEA and the future developments in that area.",13,delivering report 2
832,42,So that's the route that the county appears close to selecting.,13,delivering report 2
833,42,"Next steps in this process would be to enter preliminary engineering and design, do the NEPA review, and then work to obtain a Federal Transit Administration grant for up to 80% of the cost of the project.",13,delivering report 2
834,42,Right now we're estimating that's about a $150 million project from a capital cost perspective.,13,delivering report 2
835,42,"Just briefly touching on other efforts, we continue to work with MMSD on flood modeling and floodplain mapping.",13,delivering report 2
836,42,"Specific within the city, the Menominee River watershed is about ready.",13,delivering report 2
837,42,"In fact, the DNR just approved the last piece, so we're all going to work together to work with FEMA on a letter of map revision to get updated Menominee River floodplains across the entire river watershed.",13,delivering report 2
838,42,We also worked closely with DPW and a number of other operators and other units of government across the Milwaukee urbanized area on distributing COVID-19 transit relief funds.,13,delivering report 2
839,42,There was about $216 million given to the Milwaukee urbanized area from the Federal Transit Administration by Congress during 2020 and early 2021 that goes towards supporting operations.,13,delivering report 2
840,42,And so we worked with the transit operators to determine the appropriate distribution of that among the different operators in the Milwaukee urbanized area.,13,delivering report 2
841,42,"Similar on federal funding, we continue to work with everybody as best we can to provide information and coordination regarding the new infrastructure bill.",13,delivering report 2
842,42,"Many of the sources available to local governments generally receive between a 25% and a 35% increase in support, not all of them, but many of them.",13,delivering report 2
843,42,"And there are a few new grant opportunities, which the city staff are very aware of, that are for the first time targeted just towards units of government that are not the states, which is an unusual move by Congress.",13,delivering report 2
844,42,"Usually they run everything through the state departments of transportation, so that is an exciting opportunity, and those will happen every year over the next five years.",13,delivering report 2
845,42,"And then we continue to work, upon request, on issues of assistance when somebody asks us.",13,delivering report 2
846,42,"So an example is that we continue to work with Menominee Valley Partners and the Near West Side Partners on working on projects that will better connect those two areas across I-94, across the railroad lines, across the river, and of course the significant elevation change between those two areas as well.",13,delivering report 2
847,42,"And so when the entities that work for those reach out to us on that project, we keep moving it forward again, and some of that is on pause right now while the state further evaluates their I-94 recommendations.",13,delivering report 2
848,42,"And then we also completed a number of assistance efforts, mostly for the county that certainly still impacts the city, and I did want to note that we had three staff that helped with some of the work groups for the city-county task force on climate change and equity, providing information and data there.",13,delivering report 2
849,42,"So that completes my report, and I'm happy to talk about this or anything else any members may want to add.",13,delivering report 2
850,42,Thanks very much.,13,delivering report 2
