"Bmr020.s.2", "text": "The results presented in the former show a significant percentage of overlapping speech even without counting in backchanneling.", "type": "abstract"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.3", "text": "Additionally, the high error rate in the recognition of such overlapping speech by the SRI recogniser was minimised simply by changing the scoring method used.", "type": "abstract"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.4", "text": "Finally, a strong correlation between pauses and interruptions was confirmed.", "type": "abstract"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.5", "text": "All these measurements were based on the

"text": "An FTP directory containing such experimental data is being set up for the benefit of other researchers.", "type": "abstract"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.8", "text": "Regarding the transcriptions to be carried out by IBM, the discussion mainly concerned the format of the recordings that should be sent to them.", "type": "abstract"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.9", "text": "Suggestions included sending only the channels with the dominant speakers for transcription, but it was finally agreed on sending the original files with minimal modifications, as there will be extensive in-house post-processing.",

"abstract"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.11", "text": "The files made available in the FTP directory will be the original ones (before down-sampling), as these seem to be wanted by other parties.", "type": "decisions"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.12", "text": "Moreover, as files may have been modified through different processing, tests will be carried out in order to ensure the generation of beep files in a consistent way.", "type": "decisions"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.13", "text": "Also towards this goal, some of the time bins will need to be merged.", "type": "decisions"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.14", "text": "On the other hand, the two meetings where time bins have been hand-coded in detail will be used to fine-tune the forced alignments.", "type": "decisions"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.15", "text": "Recordings will be sent to IBM for transcription.", "type": "decisions"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.16", "text": "Before that, the files will be automatically pre-segmented into speech/non-speech bins and the beeps will be inserted.", "type": "decisions"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.17", "text": "In order to make things easier for the transcribers, breathy channels, which are erroneously marked as speech, will be re-classified correctly with other methods.", "type": "decisions"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.18", "text": "All this pre-processing will have to be evaluated first by checking a sample of the output files.", "type":

dependency is probably going to be a weak one.", "type": "problems"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.22", "text": "Additionally, the correlation between pauses in speech and interruptions does not provide a cause-and-effect link for these phenomena.", "type": "problems"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.23", "text": "The preparation of files for transcription by IBM is facing some minor difficulties, as some features (hand-coded time boundaries, multiplicity of channels etc) may complicate the generation of beep files.", "type": "problems"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.24", "text": "Besides this, the automatic pre-segmentation has been deemed to be good, but there are still no specific measurements to verify this.", "type": "problems"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.25", "text": "The pre-segmentation tool also classifies synthesised speech used in a recording as \"normal speech\" and assigns a random channel to it.", "type": "problems"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.26", "text": "The transcribers at IBM may not be able to differentiate between the two.", "type": "problems"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.27", "text": "A paper has been submitted to Eurospeech, which also includes a section on new corpora.", "type": "progress"},

the first two, the overlapped words vary between 9% and 18%.", "type": "progress"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.30", "text": "The telephone conversation results were in-between and very similar to each other.", "type": "progress"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.31", "text": "On the other hand, the automatic recognition errors affected by overlaps were reduced dramatically by focusing on regions with the foreground speech.", "type": "progress"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.32", "text": "Furthermore, it was shown that after spurts, backchannels, disfluencies and discourse markers, the likelihood of interruption by other speakers was much higher.", "type": "progress"}, {"id": "Bmr020.s.33", "text": "Files with the recordings, as well as some experimental data will be available for other researchers in an FTP directory
