76,42,"I am grateful that she has chosen to build a home for those three things that are collective in the Harambee neighborhood and first in Burleigh, a neighborhood that means a lot to her.",0,zoning changes
77,42,She has taken a formerly city-owned building that was vacant for I believe 12 years and has chosen to renovate it for the utilization that she wants to have with it.,0,zoning changes
78,42,The Department of City Development has recommended this zoning change.,0,zoning changes
79,42,I wholeheartedly support it and would hope that you all will as well.,0,zoning changes
80,42,"With that, I'll turn it over to, I don't know who you want to talk first.",0,zoning changes

85,42,I actually like the looks of this building.,0,zoning changes
86,42,It looks to be very original.,0,zoning changes
87,42,I can give the substance of the zoning change request and then I know Ms. Thompson can talk about her business and why it's such a great fit both for the building and the neighborhood.,0,zoning changes
88,42,The zoning change.,0,zoning changes
89,42,Just identify yourself.,0,zoning changes
90,42,I'm sorry.,0,zoning changes
91,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
92,42,"Sam Likling, Department of City Development, City Planning Manager.",0,zoning changes
93,42,"The request in front of the committee is to change the zoning from the current RT4 zoning, which is a residential zoning classification, to LB2 local business.",0,zoning changes
94,42,We believe that that zoning classification would both facilitate the reuse that all Roman Coggs already began to talk about.,0,zoning changes
95,42,You're going to hear a little bit more from Ms. Thompson in a moment.,0,zoning changes
96,42,It would also be consistent with the zoning of a lot of other corner establishments in Harambee and River West where you have that traditional neighborhood development pattern of having a mixed-use commercial establishment on an otherwise residential block.,0,zoning changes
97,42,The current zoning would not allow for commercial uses without various approvals by the Board of Zoning Appeals.,0,zoning changes
98,42,"And the recommendation from DCD, which would be consistent with the Northeast Side Area Plan and a lot of other planning efforts around traditional urban development, would be to rezone it to LB2 to facilitate these uses both now and in the future.",0,zoning changes
99,42,"This item was heard by our City Plan Commission at the Monday, July 18th meeting.",0,zoning changes
100,42,"After hearing a presentation from the applicant, they wholeheartedly endorsed this change and spoke very positively about it.",0,zoning changes
101,42,The Common Council has also seen this proposal before.,0,zoning changes
102,42,"This was a formerly city-owned building, and so the Council did approve the sale of the property to Ms. Thompson for the exact uses we're talking about today.",0,zoning changes
103,42,"So, again, we think it's a really straightforward and positive zoning change that's consistent with the plan and the context, and it will facilitate a pretty incredible development that you're going to hear more about.",0,zoning changes
104,42,Ms. Thompson?,0,zoning changes
105,42,Yes.,0,zoning changes
106,42,"First of all, thanks for all the work you have done for the City of Milwaukee, specifically, obviously, the Brownsville.",0,zoning changes
107,42,"I mean, I think everyone is just very proud of the work that Alderman Cox has put into it over the years.",0,zoning changes
108,42,"It's been a transformative, really, part of our city in the last 10 years, and we're grateful for women like you who are taking the leadership in that area.",0,zoning changes
109,42,Would you just tell us a little bit about your project?,0,zoning changes
110,42,"Thank you, thank you.",0,zoning changes
111,42,"I also want to thank Alderman Cox for putting me on her shoulder as a beacon, helping me make a difference in the community.",0,zoning changes
112,42,I couldn't do it without this Alderman here.,0,zoning changes
113,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
114,42,"Yes, my name is Tonda Thompson.",0,zoning changes
115,42,I've done a lot of work in the community as a mentor to young people.,0,zoning changes
116,42,I started a long time ago with Vogue Dreams Production.,0,zoning changes
117,42,"After my modeling career, I started coaching young girls and teaching them how to walk with authority, as I call it, and having a confidence in teaching them modeling, basically, to be able to combat anything that they feel that they cannot do.",0,zoning changes
118,42,"So this is a nine-year thing that has evolved into Valley Creative Collective, which is Vogue Dreams times 30.",0,zoning changes
119,42,"As mentioned, She Slays Wood is a nationally known carpentry.",0,zoning changes
120,42,We were featured on the Kelly Carson Show.,0,zoning changes
121,42,"A lot of people across the nation is, you know, ranting and raving about it, but the thing that makes me proud about She Slays Wood is that I have four young girls who are graduates of Bradley Tech, where I went to school, and they actually have the skills of a carpenter, and they can actually do the work that, you know, most men do as carpenters, and they would never have to beg anybody for a job, but any day of their lives.",0,zoning changes
122,42,"And the Harambee 5k, of course, is near and dear to that neighborhood.",0,zoning changes
123,42,"First of all, I'm from the Harambee neighborhood.",0,zoning changes
124,42,"My family house is in the Harambee neighborhood, so to get a hold of this building, which was inspired by Audubon-McCox, to see this vision come true, it's a blessing to me because it's changing the community already.",0,zoning changes
125,42,"Once our doors are open, whenever I'm there working on the building or trying to, you know, trying to figure out what's going on, what I want to do with the division, whenever the doors are open, people are flooding in, seeing how they can help make a difference within that building themselves.",0,zoning changes
126,42,So that community is heavily invested into that project.,0,zoning changes
127,42,"I've created lots of friends so far over the last year, cutting the grass outside, making sure the property stays somewhat feasible until we are able to do the work on the building.",0,zoning changes
128,42,"So I'm just, it's just, I'm an honor to make that property a beacon to that neighborhood and to change the light of what's going on on Berlion Archives.",0,zoning changes
129,42,"Mr. Chair, if you don't mind before she finishes, two things, if you can add, who some of the sponsors that have come along to assist are and also how the viewing public, if they want to know more information about Valor Collective, how they can learn that.",0,zoning changes
130,42,Absolutely.,0,zoning changes
131,42,"So we have support from Legacy Redevelopment Corporation, which is one of our our banks.",0,zoning changes
132,42,We also have support from Greater Milwaukee Foundation.,0,zoning changes
133,42,"We also have support from American Family Insurance and a host of people and neighborhood people who've donated, who've, you know, when we first bought the building, I don't know if you guys ever seen the pictures of the building inside, but it was very scary.",0,zoning changes
134,42,It was very scary.,0,zoning changes
135,42,And the neighborhood residents helped me come and clean out that building.,0,zoning changes
136,42,People donated dumpsters to help us clean up.,0,zoning changes
137,42,"So it's just been a community, you know, a poor community support.",0,zoning changes
138,42,"And there is still options to help if you like, but we have some big philanthropists coming through, helping us now and helping us get it done there.",0,zoning changes
139,42,"In addition, Milwaukee Tools, Milwaukee Bucks.",0,zoning changes
140,42,"What she says would, you know, it's a popular thing to see a woman, you know, use a hammer.",0,zoning changes
141,42,So I have support from the Milwaukee Bucks who's donated as well as Milwaukee Tools have donated tools.,0,zoning changes
142,42,"We have a huge support from a lot of different organizations across the city, but those are two of the main bigger ones that are coming on to help us.",0,zoning changes
143,42,And the website?,0,zoning changes
144,42,The website is ValorCreativeCollective.com.,0,zoning changes
145,42,That gives you access to all of the businesses that are inside of that property that will be inside of that property once we're up and running.,0,zoning changes
146,42,Could you repeat that please?,0,zoning changes
147,42,ValorCreativeCollective.com.,0,zoning changes
148,42,And the word valor means to be brave in the sight of danger.,0,zoning changes
149,42,And that's something I'm definitely doing right now.,0,zoning changes
150,42,But I don't think that neighborhood is danger.,0,zoning changes
151,42,I just think that making a huge leap of change like that could be scary.,0,zoning changes
152,42,And we're pushing through it.,0,zoning changes
153,42,That's great news.,0,zoning changes
154,42,Alderman Baumann moves for approval.,0,zoning changes
155,42,It is a public hearing.,0,zoning changes
156,42,So is there any other individuals who wish to testify in this matter?,0,zoning changes
157,42,"If you want to just elaborate a little on the woodworking of this shop, tell us a little bit more about that.",0,zoning changes
158,42,So right now my goal is to open up the windows to the shop.,0,zoning changes
159,42,I was told that's prohibited.,0,zoning changes
160,42,You shouldn't do it.,0,zoning changes
161,42,But I want people to walk by and to be able to see young women working in a wood shop.,0,zoning changes
162,42,And I want to just have that whole area just lit up.,0,zoning changes
163,42,"But She Slangs Wood, we build tables, we build, right now we're building fences so we have occupancy to do so within our building.",0,zoning changes
164,42,"So we're building fences, we're building sheds, she sheds, a lot of women like she sheds.",0,zoning changes
165,42,So we come over as a group of women and we have a good time building sheds for other women and building fences for other women.,0,zoning changes
166,42,So why did you start it?,0,zoning changes
167,42,I started it because I have a five-year-old son.,0,zoning changes
168,42,He was three at the time.,0,zoning changes
169,42,He stood on the table.,0,zoning changes
170,42,That's the story that we told on Kelly Carson Show.,0,zoning changes
171,42,My son broke the table.,0,zoning changes
172,42,"It was the middle of the pandemic and we didn't have access of, you know, going to a furniture store.",0,zoning changes
173,42,So I decided to start building the table myself.,0,zoning changes
174,42,And I'm a videographer.,0,zoning changes
175,42,He wasn't receiving much work at the time.,0,zoning changes
176,42,"We didn't know if we were going to live, to be honest, because it was right at the heart of the pandemic.",0,zoning changes
177,42,So I just started selling tables to make extra ends meet.,0,zoning changes
178,42,And I realized that a lot of other women wanted to do the same.,0,zoning changes
179,42,"So I started teaching other women that art of building, but building whatever they wanted to, whenever they could.",0,zoning changes
180,42,This is fabulous.,0,zoning changes
181,42,That's great.,0,zoning changes
182,42,So I'm going to move for approval and hearing no objections to order.,0,zoning changes
183,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
184,42,Congratulations.,0,zoning changes
185,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
186,42,"Proceeding on the agenda, item six, file number 220299, a substitute resolution writing to minor modification to the detailed plan development known as Good Hope Industrial Center to allow additional fencing and other site changes at HellermannTyton facilities located at 6701 West Good Hope Road on the south side of Good Hope Road, West North 60th Street in the 9th Automatic District.",0,zoning changes
187,42,Sam?,0,zoning changes
188,42,"Thank you, Chair Murphy.",0,zoning changes
189,42,"Again, Sam Leikling, Department of City Development.",0,zoning changes
190,42,This file in front of you is a substitute resolution that would make some adjustments to the detailed plan development that the HellermannTyton facility is located within.,0,zoning changes
191,42,It was formerly known as the Good Hope Industrial Center when that detailed plan development was created.,0,zoning changes
192,42,"Obviously, HellermannTyton is an anchor on the northwest side, providing large numbers of high quality jobs in the Granville area.",0,zoning changes
193,42,The item in front of you today is to make minor adjustments to the detailed plan development because this site is zoned detailed plan development.,0,zoning changes
194,42,The council does have purview over changes to the site and that it is controlled through the DPD zoning.,0,zoning changes
195,42,The changes that are being proposed today that you're going to hear from representatives from the company about momentarily are relatively minor changes to the fencing to increase both safety and circulation on the site as well as to add a guard shack.,0,zoning changes
196,42,"The proposal was presented to our city plan commission on Monday, July 18th at our last city plan commission meeting.",0,zoning changes
197,42,Commissioners at the commission spoke about how attractive the existing HellermannTyton building is.,0,zoning changes
198,42,They supported these adjustments.,0,zoning changes
199,42,"They did ask some questions to the team that I think you're going to hear them touch on a little bit about just how to make sure that that guard shack really blends in with the existing building, the high quality standards that HellermannTyton has throughout the site, and making sure that that is reflected in the proposal you're going to hear today and you're going to hear about that shortly from the applicant team.",0,zoning changes
200,42,"After the public or after the hearing at city plan commission, the plan commissioners did unanimously recommend approval of this DPD amendment.",0,zoning changes
201,42,We're joined by Rick Rice from HellermannTyton as well as representatives of the design team to just talk in a little bit more depth about the proposal.,0,zoning changes
202,42,Go ahead gentlemen.,0,zoning changes
203,42,So what we're proposing is expanding the expanding the fencing around the site for security.,0,zoning changes
204,42,Currently there's a small corner on the northwest side of the property that isn't fenced in and houses the visitor parking and what we're proposing is expanding the fencing to include the visitor parking and add a guard shack to check people in as they come into the facility.,0,zoning changes
205,42,"Along with that, expanding the fencing, they would be creating a drop-off lane to increase the safety for the employees that are are dropped off for each shift.",0,zoning changes
206,42,Very good.,0,zoning changes
207,42,Any questions or comments committee members?,0,zoning changes
208,42,"If not, Alderman Perez moves for approval.",0,zoning changes
209,42,Hearing no objections with my abstain on the vote and hearing no objections to order.,0,zoning changes
210,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
211,42,Proceeding on the agenda is item 720403.,0,zoning changes
212,42,Resolution directing the Department of City Development to develop an update to the housing element of the city-wide policy plan to include proposed updates to the portions of the city's zoning code that govern residential development and authorizing a transfer of funds from the capital improvements advanced planning fund to a sub-account for the housing zone code update.,0,zoning changes
213,42,This is sponsored by Alderman Baum and myself and Perez.,0,zoning changes
214,42,Thank you chair and co-sponsors.,0,zoning changes
215,42,The resolution in front of you would direct the Department of City Development to begin a process.,0,zoning changes
216,42,There's nothing final being presented today.,0,zoning changes
217,42,This would direct DCD to initiate a process to do two things.,0,zoning changes
218,42,One would be to update the housing component of the city-wide policy plan and also to recommend changes to the city the elements of the city's zoning code that regulate housing development.,0,zoning changes
219,42,The background there is obviously as you know back in 2010 the city-wide comprehensive plan including the policy city-wide policy plan was adopted.,0,zoning changes
220,42,Since then we've had a number of area plan updates.,0,zoning changes
221,42,There's been a city-wide affordable housing plan.,0,zoning changes
222,42,There's been an you know the eco office has led a climate and equity plan in conjunction with the county and we've done transitory development planning.,0,zoning changes
223,42,"A lot of those plans have made recommendations related to adding density near transit, continuing to look at things like how we regulate parking, accessory dwelling units, things like that.",0,zoning changes
224,42,And so now we do want to take the next step in actually taking some of those recommendations and doing more in-depth look at our code.,0,zoning changes
225,42,"The good news is I think when you compare us to cities across the country we have a very we have the kind of zoning code that a lot of cities across the country are in some ways emulating as far as looking at a wider mix of uses, very progressive low parking requirements, elements of the code that guide additional density toward transit, and design guidelines that really influence and prioritize the experience in the pedestrian realm.",0,zoning changes
226,42,"That said we know that we can kind of continue to make the code as the code evolves, make changes that will advance some of the mayor's goals around growth, transit-oriented development, and some of the recommendations that have come out of our past planning studies around really making sure that our code enables that kind of development that I know the council's going on record wanting to see through your adoption of various comprehensive plans, the TOD plan, the work that's going on in the climate equity plan.",0,zoning changes
227,42,So we're proposing to during 2023 carry out a project to actually begin to bring back to you all recommendations on ways that we can adjust the code to further support and enable that type of development.,0,zoning changes
228,42,We do envision there being a fair amount of community engagement and outreach in this as that's a commitment we've made throughout any of our kind of planning exercises to work with you know stakeholders to ensure that the recommendations we're bringing forward align with you know neighborhood and community goals.,0,zoning changes
229,42,And we also the resolution in front of you in addition to directing us to carry out this project would allocate funding from our existing 2022 city advanced planning budget to allow us to support some of that committee outreach and also bring on a consultant that has some experience in graphically representing some of these types of things.,0,zoning changes
230,42,You know you've probably all seen the you know the in projects in the past you know really high quality graphics that are going to be needed to demonstrate to the public that kind of you know the kind of things we're talking about the kind of concepts.,0,zoning changes
231,42,The project would be fully managed by the DC planning staff.,0,zoning changes
232,42,We think we have a fair amount of in-house expertise in this but we still are asking for some funding to be allocated to supplement with those services I just talked about.,0,zoning changes
233,42,So that's the resolution in front of you and we obviously look forward to working with all the council members on this important project as it moves forward.,0,zoning changes
234,42,Mr. Chair?,0,zoning changes
235,42,"Sure, Alderman Baumann.",0,zoning changes
236,42,You know I see this involves an expenditure of a hundred thousand dollars.,0,zoning changes
237,42,Usually when we spend a hundred thousand dollars around here we're trying to fix something fix a problem you know all in favor of expanding our knowledge and these exercises are always worthwhile but a hundred thousand dollars for consultants.,0,zoning changes
238,42,What's the problem we're trying to fix with this expenditure?,0,zoning changes
239,42,I think that when you kind of zoom back out one of the mayor's when the mayor released his economic development vision one of the planks of that vision said that he wanted to look at the zoning code to make sure that there were not any barriers to the kind of growth and development that that is part of the administration's vision that is the type of thing that have been supported by past planning efforts.,0,zoning changes
240,42,So rather than and I think that will likely involve what what's impeding our growth and expansion.,0,zoning changes
241,42,I think when you look at some of the recommendations that came out of the transitory development study a few years ago there was certainly recommendations for looking at things like the height and density allowed on some of our commercial and transit corridors and maybe looking at you know again I don't envision there being like we're not proposing to throw out the code it's kind of looking at those areas that could perhaps be tweaked to better enable some of that type of development. I think that the things that have come up a number of times in past planning efforts that we want to give some further exploration to is exactly that is kind of how we how we regulate density along some of our some of our transit and commercial corridors whether or not there is justific whether or not we should be looking at some of the ways we require or don't require or regulate parking and new development especially around transit the degree to which accessory dwelling units and different people call those different things like to interrupt you know this sounds very benign but taken to its logical extreme I think people should understand what this can represent.,0,zoning changes
242,42,This could represent a significant up zoning of neighborhoods that have been traditionally very popular for their single and two-family residential character.,0,zoning changes
243,42,Bayview is case in point if you if you rezone Bayview from an RT1234 to an RM13456 or 7 you could triple or quadruple the density of Bayview but would that be an improvement or would that be a detriment?,0,zoning changes
244,42,"Superior Street, South Shore Street, some of the most magnificent views in the city of Milwaukee are now in the possession of relatively modest single-family homes.",0,zoning changes
245,42,What would those streets look like with a row of 20-story high-rises?,0,zoning changes
246,42,And you would say well the neighbors would never sell.,0,zoning changes
247,42,"Oh no, developer comes in there willing to pay two million bucks for a house assessed at 400,000 and they might sell and you'd start to process because this happened in Chicago that's exactly how a lot of the Chicago lakefront developed or on the north side the northeast side Wall Avenue what a magnificent place for a string of high-rises or Terrace south of North Avenue what a big lots huge lots with lake views over the bluff magnificent location for high-rises",0,zoning changes
248,42,Are we really going to go there?,0,zoning changes
249,42,Because if we really want to increase density and population growth you've got to add housing units where people want to live and it's those neighborhoods where people want to live.,0,zoning changes
250,42,Is that a fair statement?,0,zoning changes
251,42,So yeah let me answer that question two ways first at the kind of macro level which I think you made a good statement there about we you know if we're going to be seeing the city grow and achieving some of the mayor's population goals we'll need to add housing units both where people want to live but across the city so I think that's a fair thing that we want to consider as we're carrying out this project in my opening comments I also said we're not bringing you final ideas or final final recommendations today so as far as like some of the very site-specific things you got into I don't pretend to come to you and say those because those are uniquely desirable residential neighborhoods because of their low density well and the thing I was going to mention the second point you know you you did you almost set us up too well to now make a plug that you know you talked about the Bayview neighborhood specifically and that is an area where we are doing detailed area planning right now led by Alderwoman Dimitrovich just tonight at from between 5 and 7 p.m. we have a meeting at South Shore Pavilion where we're going to present some initial recommendations for Bayview that have come out of the the planning process there so we are certainly looking at that and you know I've been we've certainly heard recommendations from residents in Bayview and I'm not going to pretend this has been unanimous but there's been a lot of people who said we do want to see growth in Bayview and we're certainly trying to accommodate that and and use that specific neighborhood planning process to plan for it so I think we're continuing to do the things we've always done which is plan you know both do neighborhood planning but also acknowledge the thing that you said at the start which is some of these issues when you look at regulatory tools and growth policy we do probably have to do some level of citywide analysis there so that's why we're proposing to undertake this project if you're right that depending on the way that this project unfolds like we certainly want input from the council and that's why we're proposing is a two-phase project where at the end of phase one we come back to you all at the council I presume that would come to ZND here and before we start actually writing you know writing code updates we say here are the general findings that we found here is the some general recommendations around things we want to that we want to advance and I think we'll ask the council this committee and then the council to go on record supporting that before we start right you said you know getting in the weeds of writing code because we don't want to bring you something that's not going to be able to get the support of this council additional questions Mr. Chair all the way yes please go ahead yes yes good afternoon Mr. Chair thank you and thanks for all the love for Bayview we love it and good looking out we are as Sam pointed out in almost a year and a half a very intense planning effort because we want to be part of the city solution we want to be in the driver's seat of our own future and we know we've had a lot of changes and so we are really working on a forward thinking vision how we can be more inclusive what that means what that looks and feels like and what changes need to happen and we've had some really interesting conversations in in Bayview that I'm happy to be part of that I don't think it's taken place at this level for a while however the question I had was kind of how you know how does this complement compare because I wouldn't want to support a citywide plan today that includes changes that I haven't finalized within my own district plan and I just wanted to understand that and we do have that meeting tonight where we're actually it's an open house we're going to first respond to the first draft that's that's what I'm interested in is I do believe we need a citywide plan but I mean where there's districts that are going through this intensive process I want to make sure that that's complemented and not contradicting Mr. Chair.,0,zoning changes
252,42,That's a great question all Roman and I think again I think we look forward to working with all alders as we kind of develop a more detailed scope for this project but as I've initially as we've initially thought about it I think you're right neighborhood planning will continue and neighborhood planning will likely continue kind of dictate you know key sites within individual neighborhoods and some of the you know neighborhood specific planning and how we implement those plans but there's a separate when I said the citywide aspect I also am talking I think about the overall city zoning code there are changes that we think we could be made to the code itself that are not neighborhood specific but that might help again enable some of the types of development that people have spoken about and again I don't want to like my goal today was not to get too far in any specific type of things because I know we don't I don't want to suggest that we've made final you know any kind of final conclusions but just an example that came up earlier was you know the the level of density that's currently allowed on some of our commercial corridors that that's regulated on a citywide basis through the code and there might be you know we as we've looked at in the in the past done TOD planning sorry I should stop using acronyms the transitory development planning one of the things that we've seen and we've also seen in some code administration that we've done is that perhaps you know making some kind of tweaks at the margins or turning the dials on some of those things in the code might better align with existing recommendations that have already been made in plans but have also been kind of you know are are very much citywide in nature and are not specific to one neighborhood or one site.,0,zoning changes
253,42,Mr. Chair just uh I guess I want to be a little bit more direct but what if there's a conflict I mean um like we're really being careful in Bayview to not just say what we don't want but to to say what we do want and specifically where so um you know some of the areas that Alderman Bauman mentioned um are are ones that are being heavily considered for historical preservation our plan as you know is one that's um actually using funding and you should you would love this Alderman Bauman we're doing a bit of a modest of a survey of our historical analysis at the same time while we're planning and so my point is what if like what if the citywide plan says something that conflicts with our neighborhood plan?,0,zoning changes
254,42,Right I think uh I think that's the kind of thing that we want to make sure we're being thoughtful about through the process and again like without um we do want to have more in-depth discussions with individual elders about that but I think that again at a high level one way to maybe think about that is that there's two aspects that govern you know what can you know the city's zoning and what can be done in development throughout the city and there's the zoning map which kind of talks about how individual properties are zoned and then there's also the code the text of the code and you know when we I don't anticipate that the citywide effort that we're talking about is going to get in depth about saying the zoning of site xyz should be changed it might instead say things like commercial corridors you know commercial corridors that are well served by transit and that are currently zoned you know for example our local business 2 district maybe there's tweaks that need to be made to that local business 2 district that will better enable transitory development but I don't anticipate it going in the weeds about any specific map amendments.,0,zoning changes
255,42,So my vote today is not actually changing any code right now.,0,zoning changes
256,42,No this is just the item that's in front of the committee today is to just initiate this process with much of the work taking place during 2023 in close partnership and close coordination with not just the elders on this committee but the elders that yeah and it would also allocate funding for us to begin the process.,0,zoning changes
257,42,Okay all right thank you Mr. Chair appreciate it.,0,zoning changes

385,42,Okay.,0,zoning changes
386,42,What was that conversation?,0,zoning changes
387,42,"Well, the conversation was like, can we, in any way possible, take a color out of the old brick to match it up as close as possible?",0,zoning changes
388,42,"I said, yeah, it's possible.",0,zoning changes
389,42,You can take one of the colors.,0,zoning changes
390,42,"The original brick got maybe about three or four different colors in there, and you would have to probably paint one of those colors out of that brick to paint the house over again.",0,zoning changes
391,42,But you can also put what this man suggested.,0,zoning changes
392,42,"You can put that over that paint and introduce a different color into it, into the grain of the brick.",0,zoning changes
393,42,Okay.,0,zoning changes

409,42,"Everything, Mr. Chair?",0,zoning changes
410,42,"Go ahead, Alderman Baumann.",0,zoning changes
411,42,"Thank you, Mr. Chairman, to Alderman Stamper and members of the committee.",0,zoning changes
412,42,"I mean, this is, the Historic Preservation Commission discussed this case at length at least twice, and it was our final judgment that there is no possible way we could issue a certificate of appropriateness in this case, because that would basically be saying that this is appropriate when it clearly isn't appropriate.",0,zoning changes
413,42,"What complicates the case is that we're hearing from experts that said, well, there's nothing you can do about it.",0,zoning changes
414,42,"Well, that even makes it worse to issue a COA, because once we issue a COA for full house painting of brick buildings, why would anyone else not do it and just go out and do it and not apply for the proper review?",0,zoning changes
415,42,"And if someone complained, there'd be a hearing, and they'd say, well, you gave it to this gentleman.",0,zoning changes
416,42,We're entitled to the same after-the-fact approval as you got.,0,zoning changes
417,42,And so basically your historic standards essentially are out the window for Sherman Boulevard.,0,zoning changes
418,42,It's a practical matter.,0,zoning changes
419,42,"Anyone can do anything they want, and they'll automatically get an appeal approved by the council.",0,zoning changes
420,42,So why even bother at some point?,0,zoning changes
421,42,There's no point in having historic preservation.,0,zoning changes
422,42,"There's no point focusing on the great blocks of Grant Boulevard and Sherman Boulevard, because if you start granting everybody an exception because they're nice guys or you feel sorry for them, you might as well abolish historic preservation in those neighborhoods and everybody for himself.",0,zoning changes
423,42,"So that's a policy call, and maybe that's what the neighborhood wants.",0,zoning changes
424,42,"Maybe the neighborhood wants to abolish historic preservation on Grant Boulevard and Sherman Boulevard, and that's their right to make that point.",0,zoning changes
425,42,That's the right of their local elected official to advance that argument.,0,zoning changes
426,42,"I suspect there will be some neighbors who object to that, but that's why we have democracy.",0,zoning changes
427,42,We cannot grant a COA for this unless you want the integrity of the historic review process completely destroyed.,0,zoning changes
428,42,It's just that simple.,0,zoning changes
429,42,I realize we're in a political environment.,0,zoning changes
430,42,That's fine.,0,zoning changes
431,42,"If that's the political choice, we live with it.",0,zoning changes
432,42,But understand what you're doing.,0,zoning changes
433,42,Fully understand the big-picture consequences of granting this appeal.,0,zoning changes
434,42,"Now, if people want to work together and find a solution, great.",0,zoning changes
435,42,Then we hold this and get a report back in September as to how it went.,0,zoning changes
436,42,But I just wanted to put that out there so people understood it's not a matter of nice guys or we feel sorry for you or it's an excusable neglect situation.,0,zoning changes
437,42,"What they did was arguably irreversible, and that puts this in a very unique category.",0,zoning changes
438,42,"Yeah, I get that.",0,zoning changes
439,42,But I can tell from Mr. Griffin there was no ill intent.,0,zoning changes
440,42,He didn't know about it.,0,zoning changes
441,42,He didn't know he was in a historic area.,0,zoning changes
442,42,"So, I mean, in one aspect of it, it was done, I think, unintentionally, right?",0,zoning changes
443,42,"But now it can't be reversed because, as our experts say, it's pretty much done.",0,zoning changes
444,42,"But you can try and mitigate it as much as possible, but it's not going to be a big change.",0,zoning changes
445,42,"But I think it's appropriate to hold it, to give it a shot, and see what our options are to try and make a little bit less of it.",0,zoning changes
446,42,"Do we not, as a city, notify when there's a sale transaction?",0,zoning changes
447,42,It's part of their deed.,0,zoning changes
448,42,Is it part of the deed itself?,0,zoning changes
449,42,The federal report will show that.,0,zoning changes
450,42,It will show that.,0,zoning changes
451,42,It is in the title report.,0,zoning changes
452,42,"Unfortunately, Milwaukee County wants to charge us $800 a month to be able to even have access to the database to send out letters.",0,zoning changes
453,42,So have we been doing that?,0,zoning changes
454,42,No.,0,zoning changes
455,42,So how would he know?,0,zoning changes
456,42,Because it's in the deed.,0,zoning changes
457,42,And we are sure and absolutely it was in his deed.,0,zoning changes
458,42,Totally complete.,0,zoning changes
459,42,"And we did mail out these pamphlets, and actually twice now.",0,zoning changes
460,42,"Yeah, we sent it out again this year.",0,zoning changes
461,42,"Starting last year after a long hiatus, we have mailed out this brochure to every owner in the city.",0,zoning changes
462,42,"We frequently get this, Alderman Murphy.",0,zoning changes
463,42,What's that?,0,zoning changes
464,42,"We frequently get this situation when people buy a sheriff's sale where there's no title report and no title insurance, or land contract transactions where there's no title insurance.",0,zoning changes
465,42,"So then they don't even know, yeah.",0,zoning changes
466,42,"And what is the city supposed to do, go around and?",0,zoning changes
467,42,"Yeah, I mean, I understand.",0,zoning changes
468,42,"Go ahead, Mr. Griffin.",0,zoning changes
469,42,You had any further comments?,0,zoning changes
470,42,Not at this time.,0,zoning changes
471,42,I would like an opportunity to speak.,0,zoning changes
472,42,Sure.,0,zoning changes
473,42,What's your name?,0,zoning changes
474,42,"My name is Charles Stewart, and I would like to respond to the complainant regarding this property.",0,zoning changes
475,42,My family has been in the historic renovation and purchase of properties in Milwaukee and historic districts.,0,zoning changes
476,42,Your question is on the microphone.,0,zoning changes
477,42,"Oh, okay.",0,zoning changes
478,42,My name is Charles Stewart.,0,zoning changes
479,42,My family has been in the building and historical maintenance of properties that my grandfather built in the 1920s.,0,zoning changes
480,42,This is a property that my grandfather built.,0,zoning changes
481,42,He was a carpenter.,0,zoning changes
482,42,My uncle was a mason.,0,zoning changes
483,42,I personally purchased this property approximately 10 years ago so that it would be properly maintained and honored the quality of the building that he did.,0,zoning changes
484,42,"Obviously, he found an excellent architect.",0,zoning changes
485,42,The house is designed terrifically.,0,zoning changes
486,42,"So I purchased the property, and Mr. Griffin has been employed by me for 15 years as a painter, almost exclusively on historic properties.",0,zoning changes
487,42,I have owned properties in each of the historic districts in Milwaukee.,0,zoning changes
488,42,"It's Wall Avenue and 3417 North Sherman and 2863 North Grant, and I picked up the pieces from the city and the federal government on these historic houses, got the certificates of appropriateness and all of the above, and I want to see this house partially repainted since there seems to be an objection.",0,zoning changes
489,42,"I do own and I have developed properties interior-wise that are in historic districts, and as I say, Mr. Griffin was the one that did all of the work.",0,zoning changes
490,42,He's also a carpenter.,0,zoning changes
491,42,"So my impression of what's appropriate based on what my family built carpentry-wise, what my family did mason-wise, the architect they chose, this is not an attempt to start a revolution of people painting everything in appropriate colors.",0,zoning changes
492,42,"I feel that there are properties that are in the gray spectrum of colors that have been approved for the other historic districts, one of which I used to own.",0,zoning changes
493,42,"So I just want it understood that the legacy of the property is partially my family's, and that's why I sold it to Mr. David Griffin, because I wanted to make certain that it had the best of care and attention, and I did not want to sell it to a flipper or a dipper or anything else.",0,zoning changes
494,42,I wanted to sell it to a resident of the neighborhood who will live there.,0,zoning changes
495,42,"He has 10-year financing with me, and in 10 years it will be paid off and his family will have an asset in a great community.",0,zoning changes
496,42,So that's it.,0,zoning changes
497,42,"Okay, thank you.",0,zoning changes
498,42,So you knew this was an historic district?,0,zoning changes
499,42,I knew it was a historic property.,0,zoning changes
500,42,"No, you knew this property was in an historic district?",0,zoning changes
501,42,That is correct.,0,zoning changes
502,42,And you sold it to him on land contract?,0,zoning changes
503,42,That is correct.,0,zoning changes
504,42,"So there was no warranty deed conveyed from you to him, correct?",0,zoning changes
505,42,That is correct.,0,zoning changes
506,42,So you knew it was in a historic district?,0,zoning changes
507,42,"Yes, it was in the same district as Grant Boulevard and 3417 Sherman, 2863 Grant, which I also owned.",0,zoning changes
508,42,And you didn't think it was relevant to tell him?,0,zoning changes
509,42,"Apparently both the city and the federal government that I purchased each of these properties from, which took almost a year, they made me sign a statement that says there's no asbestos here, there's no lead here, when there were kids 2 years old, a 4-year-old Hispanic on 2863.",0,zoning changes
510,42,What does that have to do with historic districts?,0,zoning changes
511,42,It's got to do with the fact that I was lied to about the condition of these properties when I purchased them.,0,zoning changes
512,42,"Yes, they were historic.",0,zoning changes
513,42,Who lied to you?,0,zoning changes
514,42,The city of Milwaukee.,0,zoning changes
515,42,"If Tom Barrow was here, he'd say...",0,zoning changes
516,42,He'd say he was lied to?,0,zoning changes
517,42,"No, he would say I had a conference, a press conference, on the porch of the house that I appropriately rehabbed and got a certificate of appropriateness for the central area unit outside.",0,zoning changes
518,42,I know the law.,0,zoning changes
519,42,So you've gone through the COE process on this property?,0,zoning changes
520,42,"Yes, I have.",0,zoning changes
521,42,"And it bothers me that somebody wants to get off track with a property owner who couldn't be more appropriate and is willing to change the color, essentially, back to a derivative of what it was.",0,zoning changes
522,42,"If somebody in the neighborhood doesn't like the color, that's...",0,zoning changes
523,42,It's not a matter of liking the color.,0,zoning changes
524,42,It's contrary to the design standards adopted by the Common Council when the historic district was created.,0,zoning changes
525,42,It's not a matter of liking.,0,zoning changes
526,42,We're changing it.,0,zoning changes
527,42,We're not asking you to keep the color that you think is inappropriate.,0,zoning changes
528,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
529,42,That's what we're here for.,0,zoning changes
530,42,Then we can get to the patches and the color and restore it so that might...,0,zoning changes
531,42,"All right, so the motion is to hold it.",0,zoning changes
532,42,So we're going to hold this item and see what we can do in terms of compromise and come back before the meeting.,0,zoning changes
533,42,"Mr. Chair, Mr. Chair.",0,zoning changes
534,42,"Yeah, thank you.",0,zoning changes
535,42,"On the whole, does everybody know what we're facing here?",0,zoning changes
536,42,"So if we deny it, what happens?",0,zoning changes
537,42,"And if we hold it, are they going to come back with a historical preservation approval or something similar?",0,zoning changes
538,42,"I mean, I think the motion to hold it is to find out if there's any potential technical solution to assist in lessening the issue.",0,zoning changes
539,42,"But his appeal still stands, and it would come back before the committee, but we would get a better feel of what that is.",0,zoning changes
540,42,"But I guess to run the logic out, if the appeal is denied and he does not receive the certificate of appropriateness, what's the outcome of that?",0,zoning changes
541,42,What happens because it's painted?,0,zoning changes
542,42,Right.,0,zoning changes
543,42,What happens?,0,zoning changes
544,42,What happens?,0,zoning changes
545,42,"Eventually, DNS takes it to court.",0,zoning changes
546,42,For what?,0,zoning changes
547,42,For a fine?,0,zoning changes
548,42,Yes.,0,zoning changes
549,42,And is it a one-time fine?,0,zoning changes
550,42,"Typically, until some sort of remedy is achieved.",0,zoning changes
551,42,"But as you indicated, you can't change it.",0,zoning changes
552,42,It's too late.,0,zoning changes
553,42,"So that's not an acceptable solution, right?",0,zoning changes
554,42,Yes.,0,zoning changes
555,42,"And, Mr. Chair, for the record, I would like to say that if this had just been the stucco, we wouldn't even be here.",0,zoning changes
556,42,It's the brick.,0,zoning changes
557,42,I get it.,0,zoning changes
558,42,"But I mean, the logic is you're not going to find them if you can't fix it.",0,zoning changes
559,42,"The court's going to say to you, the guy can't fix it.",0,zoning changes
560,42,How does the court do that?,0,zoning changes
561,42,Historic HPC.,0,zoning changes
562,42,"Yeah, I get that, but I'm just running the logic out of it.",0,zoning changes
563,42,Yeah.,0,zoning changes
564,42,"I mean, there are mineral.",0,zoning changes
565,42,Can we finish the logic?,0,zoning changes
566,42,"Please, let's finish the logic.",0,zoning changes
567,42,What happens?,0,zoning changes
568,42,"I'm just saying that more than likely, if the appeal is not granted, DCE takes them to court.",0,zoning changes
569,42,And it gets to court.,0,zoning changes
570,42,And the court's going to do what they want to do.,0,zoning changes
571,42,"But, I mean, usually in this case, it's like a fine.",0,zoning changes
572,42,And you can increase that fine or have a monthly increase into the fine or it's a monthly fine.,0,zoning changes
573,42,"But, I mean, the solution is to fix it.",0,zoning changes
574,42,"And the court's going to ask, well, why can't you fix it?",0,zoning changes
575,42,"And the Housing Historical Preservation is going to say, you can't fix it.",0,zoning changes
576,42,They're testifying today.,0,zoning changes
577,42,You can't really fix it.,0,zoning changes
578,42,So I'm just telling you that's reality.,0,zoning changes
579,42,"We're all saying here that a mineral paint may be an option to lessen the effect, at least.",0,zoning changes
580,42,Okay.,0,zoning changes
581,42,So he's going to try and maybe do that.,0,zoning changes
582,42,"Go ahead, sir.",0,zoning changes
583,42,Yes.,0,zoning changes
584,42,"I could, if they want to, we could paint the whole house or stain the whole house again to the color of one of the colors out of the original brick.",0,zoning changes
585,42,That can be done.,0,zoning changes
586,42,Okay.,0,zoning changes
587,42,There's just no problem with that.,0,zoning changes
588,42,This can be done.,0,zoning changes
589,42,It's just we're sitting down at the table making a decision on what color we want to paint the house.,0,zoning changes
590,42,"Well, that's why you reasoned the motion by Allman Stamper and Allman Bonds to hold it to try and get to that situation.",0,zoning changes
591,42,So we're going to hold it.,0,zoning changes
592,42,Right.,0,zoning changes
593,42,And so we're just trying to find a solution.,0,zoning changes
594,42,Okay.,0,zoning changes
595,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
596,42,Thank you.,0,zoning changes
597,42,I hear no objection to that motion.,0,zoning changes
598,42,It's held.,0,zoning changes
599,42,"Okay, sir.",0,zoning changes
600,42,Proceeding on the agenda.,0,zoning changes
601,42,"Item 10, file number 211891.",0,zoning changes
602,42,"Excuse me, file 11, file number 220286, communication with Department of City Development, transmitting the 2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics.",1,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
603,42,"I mean, I get what you're saying.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
604,42,I get what you're saying.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
605,42,Yeah.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
606,42,"No, I figured you would.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
607,42,You've been through this before.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
608,42,Charles Stewart.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
609,42,Okay.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
610,42,"Good afternoon, Mr. Chairman.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
611,42,Laurie Letzko with the Department of City Development.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
612,42,"I'm here with my colleague, David Peat.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
613,42,We're here for our Annual Tax Incremental Financing District Report for the year 2021.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
614,42,And all expenditures and activity are through December 31st of 2021.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
615,42,"I'm going to turn it over to my colleague, David Peat, to give you an overview of our TID portfolio.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
616,42,David.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
617,42,Hi.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
618,42,"I'm Dave Peat, the Budget Manager for the Department of City Development.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
619,42,What we have is our Annual Report that's always due by July 1st of every year.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
620,42,It's an annual submission that we do.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
621,42,We actually have to do it for the Department of Revenue now.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
622,42,"Every year we submit just the numbers, but we try to supply you with an actual narrative and give you updates on what's actually going on more than just what the numbers are saying.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
623,42,The 2021 TID audit was recently finished.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
624,42,So that should be probably presented by the Comptroller's Office soon.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
625,42,I don't know exactly when.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
626,42,But that one's done.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
627,42,Our numbers are unaudited in this report.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
628,42,It does not include any of the accruals or anything like that.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
629,42,That would be done after the end of the year.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
630,42,"At the end of 2021, we had 60 open or active tax incremental districts.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
631,42,It was consistent with the prior year.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
632,42,The incremental property value generated from all our TID portfolio right now is about $2.2 billion.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
633,42,It's approximately the same as it has been in the prior year.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
634,42,And the value represents about 6.33% of the entire city's value.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
635,42,We are limited to 12% of the entire city's value for TIDs.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
636,42,"Our projections right now is the future project costs that we need to recover is almost $147 million, which includes the debt service, but it does not include the developer-financed TIDs.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
637,42,"So in 2021, we had several TIDs that were created as well as amended.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
638,42,So I'm just going to give you a brief overview.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
639,42,"Many of you have seen these before this committee, and the council has approved them.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
640,42,"So our first TID that was created in 2021 was TID 107, Chapel Gardens.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
641,42,This project is an affordable housing redevelopment of a former convent and outbuilding that is owned by the Sisters of St. Francis on South Layton Boulevard at Greenfield Avenue.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
642,42,It comprises of 43 total units.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
643,42,"Fifty-nine of the units are one- and two-bedroom units for the elderly, and then there were four three-bedroom units for families.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
644,42,"In total, it was a $16.2 million investment.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
645,42,"The city's TIF investment is $720,000, and again, it was followed by our affordable housing TIF policy.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
646,42,It is a developer-financed TIF for a term of 20 years with a 4.75% interest rate.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
647,42,"This development is being led by the Sisters of St. Francis and General Capital Development, and it is slated to be completed by the end of this year.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
648,42,"Mr. Chair, I'm just curious.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
649,42,These are units just available to the public?,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
650,42,Yes.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
651,42,Thank you.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
652,42,You're welcome.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
653,42,"Another TID that was created in 2021 was TID 108, 5th and Michigan.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
654,42,"This project renovated a 350,000-square-foot office building and 850-stall parking structure.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
655,42,It was purchased by Milwaukee Tool and is the home of Milwaukee Tool.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
656,42,It is located at 5th and Michigan on the west side of Milwaukee's downtown.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
657,42,It is a $30-plus million investment.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
658,42,"The city provided a $12.1 million TIF for a commitment of 1,210 new jobs by 2026.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
659,42,"There was a human resource agreement for this development, and as reported at not the most recent but a couple, maybe two cycles ago, their HR requirements are being met and exceeded in this case, 40% RPP and 25% SBE.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
660,42,There is an option for an additional $7.9 million of TIF.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
661,42,If the company decides to expand the building and add another 790 jobs.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
662,42,"For this development, we are paying $10,000 for a new job in the region.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
663,42,"Our first TID last year that was amended was Sigma Aldridge, TID 52.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
664,42,It was Amendment 1.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
665,42,"This TID was very close to its expiration date, so we decided to look at our portfolio.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
666,42,"There were three underperforming affordable housing TIDs, and we were able to do an allocation amendment, meaning that we donated to three underperforming TIDs.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
667,42,"Either there was no increment coming in or very little, and the likelihood of it being paid off within the 27 years that TIDs have to pay off was very unlikely.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
668,42,"So we made the decision to amend this TID for a little bit more than $312,000, and we paid off TID 58 at 20th and Walnut for almost $55,000.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
669,42,"We also paid off TID 65 at 20th and Brown for a little bit more than $16,500, and then we also paid off TID 66 at Metcalf Park for a little bit more than $241,000.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
670,42,"TID 70, 735 North Water Street, we amended this TID for the second time.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
671,42,"There were some emergency repairs that needed to be done on city-owned segments of our Riverwalk at Mason Street and Wisconsin Avenue, so we amended this TID for $250,000, and our Department of Public Works conducted those repairs last year, and they are complete.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
672,42,"Another TID that was amended was TID 85, 6th and National.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
673,42,"This was the first amendment to this TID, and it was led by President Perez, then Alderman.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
674,42,"The TID was amended for $1.275 million, and there were a few things we amended the project plan for.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
675,42,"$900,000 for street improvements to address reckless driving along 6th Street and Mineral Streets.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
676,42,"There was $250,000 in new project costs for planning and engineering for the Walkers Point Streetcar Extension, $50,000 for bike amenities, and $75,000 for administration of the TID.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
677,42,"And here's just a map kind of showing 6th Street from Virginia down to National, and you can see it's very faint, but you'll see bump-outs, pedestrian high visibility crosswalks for pedestrians for a better pedestrian experience and to try to slow down traffic, and then from National down to Mineral Street.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
678,42,"It's our understanding the Department of Public Works have completed the design and engineering, and they will be going out for a bid for these improvements.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
679,42,Mr. Chair?,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
680,42,"Hold on a minute, President.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
681,42,"Yeah, for the record, I believe that it's going all the way from Virginia to Washington.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
682,42,Okay.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
683,42,"And I believe you, but the report says Mineral, so it goes a little further south?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
684,42,Just a block.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
685,42,Just a block?,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
686,42,Okay.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
687,42,As long as that works for you.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
688,42,It's further north than National.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
689,42,"Right, no, it goes to Virginia.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
690,42,"Right, right, right, yeah.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
691,42,"No, as long as the improvements are within that half mile.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
692,42,I just don't want anyone listening that it was different from what they were told.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
693,42,"Okay, thank you.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
694,42,And then normally we conduct a housing resolution.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
695,42,"Actually, our budget office does.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
696,42,"The department gives a list of TIDs that are ready to close, and the last year's increment will be used in the next year's budget, so in this case it would be this year's budget, to pay for some of our housing programs and our Strong Neighborhood Hoods Plan.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
697,42,"So normally this resolution would have been passed in November, but instead it was passed early January, but it did allow for almost $458,000 for the 2022 budget, so those dollars are now in this year's budget for many of our Strong Neighborhood Hoods Plan programs.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
698,42,Two TIDs were closed last year.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
699,42,"We dissolved TID 22, the Bear Line B, and TID 66, Metcalfe Park Homes.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
700,42,"And looking ahead for 2022 activity, many of these have already occurred, but I'll just quickly go through.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
701,42,"We closed three districts this year, TID 52, Sigma Aldridge, TID 58, 20th and Walnut, TID 65, 20th and Brown, and then paving and infrastructure.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
702,42,"When a TID has paid off all its project costs, we look at the TID and we provide a half-mile map to the Department of Public Works, and we amend the TID to provide public infrastructure improvements.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
703,42,So already a lot of this has occurred.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
704,42,"TID 41, Time Warner Riverwalk, the last Z&D meeting, $5.5 million in public infrastructure was approved, as well as $1 million in housing.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
705,42,"TID 42, Midtown, TID 49, Cathedral Place, TID 54, Stadium Business Park, those were approved earlier this year.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
706,42,"Again, infrastructure dollars to address reckless driving and improve roads in these district foundries.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
707,42,"And then TID 70, 735 Northwater, you approved that at your last meeting.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
708,42,"And that, too, was for Riverwalk.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
709,42,"And TID 76, 27th and Howard, and TID 77, Hillerman-Titan, those TID maps are at the Department of Public Works, but those TIDs will also be amended in the near future to pay for public infrastructure.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
710,42,"So just this year alone, over $14 million has been approved in public infrastructure dollars to address reckless driving throughout the city by using our TIDs.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
711,42,So that really concludes the report.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
712,42,We have online the narratives and more in-depth on the financials of each of the districts.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
713,42,And so David and I are here to answer any questions that the committee has.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
714,42,Thank you very much.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
715,42,You're welcome.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
716,42,"A quick question for you is just in this year alone, have we had any underperforming districts?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
717,42,"And if we have, have the other districts made up for their losses?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
718,42,And which ones are they?,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
719,42,"I would say the only TID that is still not performing, but I believe we'll have an increment this year once we get the final numbers from the DOR in August, was Century City.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
720,42,"But if you remember, the council has approved nearly, I don't know how many amendments, maybe four.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
721,42,And we have like $2 million worth of the $25 million left on the book.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
722,42,"So we're hoping that enough increment will be produced to pay down that $2 million, or else we'll look again to another TID to pay down the last $2 million of debt for the Century City TID.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
723,42,"Other than that, our TID portfolio is very healthy, and we do not have any other.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
724,42,What about ICON?,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
725,42,"Well, the ICON, the initial investment of $4 million, we're not quite there.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
726,42,"He still has a little bit of that left, but we're waiting for the developer to start with the development, and we will be meeting with him within the next couple weeks.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
727,42,We're going to take another tour of the site.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
728,42,He has not secured his financing to move the project forward.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
729,42,"So that was a loan, though.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
730,42,"The developer is supposed to be paying the loan back to the city, that $4 million.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
731,42,"We extended that through the council-approved extension, and I believe August 1st is that deadline.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
732,42,So we will have to make another decision.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
733,42,That's next week.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
734,42,"Yeah, that's next week, correct.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
735,42,Yeah.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
736,42,Yeah.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
737,42,"Payment due, I believe, September 1st.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
738,42,September 1st.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
739,42,Yeah.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
740,42,Okay.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
741,42,And what typically happens if it's not paid?,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
742,42,"Well, there's a couple things that could happen.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
743,42,"If he doesn't pay, we could look at, you know, foreclosure.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
744,42,"I mean, there's different scenarios.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
745,42,We just haven't gotten there yet.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
746,42,"I mean, but we are aware.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
747,42,Go ahead.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
748,42,"No, I'm done.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
749,42,"Well, can you keep not only this committee but the council very much attuned to what that scenario is and that we want to receive information on that?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
750,42,"Yes, we can.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
751,42,I'll have the project manager do that once we get to that point.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
752,42,All right.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
753,42,"So, Mr. Chair?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
754,42,Yes.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
755,42,"So for anyone listening, is there a plan in neighborhoods per se to look at TIFs differently, to move the needle with development in neighborhoods that people should have on their radar or expect to see?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
756,42,"I would say we look at our area plans, and in those plans there's catalytic projects.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
757,42,"And development is led by the private sector, as you well know.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
758,42,"So when we have somebody in the private sector approach the department, we look at the area plans as an indicator.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
759,42,"You know, is this something that the community wants to see move forward?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
760,42,We don't just look at TIF.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
761,42,We look at all our programs to see what best fits and what meets the priorities of the administration and the council.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
762,42,"And historically it's been affordable housing, as you're well aware.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
763,42,It could be infrastructure.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
764,42,It could be historic preservation in some cases.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
765,42,Jobs are a big indicator.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
766,42,Or just the redevelopment of an important building within that commercial corridor.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
767,42,So we work with the local aldermen to help guide us with that decision.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
768,42,Okay.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
769,42,All right.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
770,42,"I think that's the conclusion of your report, correct?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
771,42,"Yes, it was just questions.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
772,42,It's just a communication file.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
773,42,Right.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
774,42,"Any additional questions, comments?",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
775,42,"If not, at this time, Ombudsman Baumann moves to receive and place some filing.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
776,42,"Hearing no objections, so ordered.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
777,42,Thank you.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
778,42,Item 12 and 13 we're going to take together.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
779,42,One is 21-1513 and 22-0316.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
780,42,They're communications to the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission relating to the 2020 annual and 2021 annual report.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
781,42,"Good afternoon, Chair, members of the committee.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
782,42,Thanks for having me.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
783,42,You're welcome.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
784,42,So I'm before you to just briefly discuss the 2020 and the 2021 annual report from the Southeastern Wisconsin Regional Planning Commission.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
785,42,"They were attached to the files, but I also have a very brief presentation just touching on highlights from the two years combined.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
786,42,"And, of course, happy to take questions as the Chair determines is appropriate.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
787,42,I think everyone here is familiar with the Regional Planning Commission.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
788,42,"So just very briefly, this is the region we serve.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
789,42,"Seven counties, 147 cities, villages, and towns, about 2 million people, and 1.3 million jobs in Southeastern Wisconsin.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
790,42,"It is about a third of the state's population, wealth, and land.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
791,42,"Sorry, population, jobs, and wealth, but only about 5% of the state's land.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
792,42,"At the Regional Planning Commission, our role is enabled by state statutes which provide advisory area-wide planning specifically for public infrastructure and development of the region.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
793,42,"And in addition, we are the Metropolitan Planning Organization for Southeastern Wisconsin for the five urbanized areas.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
794,42,That's a federal transportation role that is also largely advisory but does have a little bit more teeth to it than state statutes in that projects cannot move forward with federal funds unless they are in the Long-Range Transportation Plan and our Short-Range Transportation Improvement Program.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
795,42,"So sticking to the recent highlights, and council committees actually received updates on a number of these efforts as we were going along, but we did complete the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the region.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
796,42,That is an every-five-year effort that we do in partnership with M7.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
797,42,"Specific to that effort, the purpose of it, in addition to doing exactly what it says, setting the Comprehensive Economic Development Strategy for the region, is to make parts of the region eligible for Economic Development Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Economic Development Administration grants throughout any distressed area in the region.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
798,42,"Those distressed areas do change every year, but they are essentially based on having higher unemployment rates or higher poverty rates.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
799,42,"So that effort does keep the region and many parts of the city of Milwaukee eligible for those EDA grants, which I know city staff are hard at work at pursuing.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
800,42,Another thing that was completed during the past two years is an update to Vision 2050.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
801,42,This is the Long-Range Land Use and Transportation Plan for the region.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
802,42,"Alderman Baumann is on the Regional Transportation Plan Advisory Committee, so he's very familiar with this effort.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
803,42,"Very high-level, this plan essentially encourages reinvesting in urban cores across the region, the largest, of course, being the city of Milwaukee, protecting areas with high environmental value, which the Commission has recommended for a number of years and actually this region has been particularly exceptional at accomplishing, building a variety of housing types and price points, and in particular trying to make sure that housing in some parts of the region is better aligned with the type of jobs that are in those locations across the region, mitigating congestion and investing in roadways to improve condition, and near and dear to my heart, expanding access to jobs, education, health care, and other needs via transit, biking, and walking.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
804,42,"There's a recommendation in the plan for a more than doubling in transit investment across the region, which obviously requires quite a bit of assistance from the state that thus far the region has been unable to obtain.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
805,42,"Two big regional efforts we're working on right now, this one does apply to the city of Milwaukee, but perhaps less applicable in some ways, but I did want to touch on it anyways.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
806,42,"The Regional Chloride Impact Study, this is all about salt, so we're looking at the impact of and the sources of salt in the region's lakes, rivers, and streams, and in particular the reason we're looking at this, this was a request from Walworth County, the most rural county in the region.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
807,42,"Obviously when you think about salt running off in the lakes, rivers, and streams, you think of road salt, but actually depending on where you are in the region, there may be many other things besides the road salt that is contributing to growing salinity in our lakes, rivers, and streams, and there is also not a process that removes salt once it is in, in particular, the lakes.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
808,42,"Obviously it flows through the rivers and streams, but then it ends up in the lakes and it does stay in the lakes.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
809,42,"So the reason Walworth County was interested in this is Lake Geneva, the largest inland lake in the region, very deep lake, very large lake, but also has a very small watershed, and yet the salinity of Lake Geneva was increasing over time, and so they were trying to figure out with such a small watershed, why would salt runoff from the roads be causing such an increase in salt, and the answer in that area is actually water softeners.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
810,42,"And so what we're doing with this effort is looking at the watersheds across the region, trying to identify the proportional contribution, and then also identifying best practices, new technologies, recommendations that can be made to balance salt use with public safety, and quality of life concerns.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
811,42,"Obviously the most common thing to do with the roads the city is doing, which is the brining process, increases the effectiveness of salt for a road to make sure to melt snow and ice, but it also reduces the amount of salt, so you're using less salt and doing it more effectively than just spraying rock salt after the storm occurs.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
812,42,"Another regional effort that is underway, and this actually was a request from the Deputy Commissioner of the Department of City Development, Vanessa Koster, as well as also a request from a commissioner from Walworth County, we are doing our very first regional food system plan.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
813,42,"We haven't been directly involved in this in the past, but essentially the drivers for this effort are to look at healthy food access across the region, obviously a challenge in the lowest income parts of the region, which is the most urban parts of the region, and also the most rural parts of the region.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
814,42,And so we have a challenge in both of those locations around healthy food access.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
815,42,"We also have a statewide challenge regarding the financial sustainability of family farms, and so we're working with a number of partners who have been in this area much longer than we have to try to figure out if there's a way that we can increase the financial sustainability of farming operations, the environmental sustainability of it, and also increase access to healthy foods in many parts of the region.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
816,42,"I did want to note some things that are a little bit more specific to the city, or at least the immediate area here.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
817,42,So one effort that we did that was a bit of a branch out for us as a planning agency is FlexRide Milwaukee.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
818,42,"We worked with the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and they in fact took the lead at the School of Architecture and Urban Planning there.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
819,42,The Department of Urban Planning took the lead on applying for a National Science Foundation grant.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
820,42,"They succeeded in getting a million-dollar National Science Foundation grant, which is being used through the end of October to experiment with different flexible transit-type services to connect people to suburban jobs.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
821,42,So the green zones and the yellow zones on the map there are the zones within the city.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
822,42,"People can use a smartphone app or dial a number, a phone number, to request a ride and take it out to family-sustaining jobs in Menomonee Falls and Butler.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
823,42,"The project team, there's a number of entities involved in this project, but the project team was successful in obtaining a workforce investment grant from the State Department of Workforce Development and WEDC, and so that service will be extended into other parts of the region and also further out.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
824,42,So it won't end in October anymore.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
825,42,It will run at least through December 2024.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
826,42,So we're excited to at least do a little bit to try to increase access to those suburban jobs that haven't been accessible to people who don't have a car or don't wish to drive in the past.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
827,42,"Also, an effort for Milwaukee County, but heavily impacting the city and involving the city and its residents, we are working through a north-south transit enhancement study running the length of 27th Street.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
828,42,We have briefed the other persons whose districts this project would run through.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
829,42,"Essentially, what we're working with the county on is taking a look at how to enhance the existing Purple Line to, again, increase speeds, make the service more desirable, and make it more useful for both its existing users and its future users.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
830,42,"As members of this committee and Alderman Baumann in particular know, we did look at a variety of potential paths for this enhanced transit service, including using the 30th Street Industrial Corridor, the actual rail corridor there.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
831,42,"There were a number of reasons that that was determined to not move forward, but where we are now is very close to having a recommendation that runs from Bayshore and Glendale along Silver Spring to the west until it reaches Tetonia, heading south on Tetonia until 27th Street starts, and then all the way south on 27th Street down to the Northwestern Mutual Franklin campus and the IKEA and the future developments in that area.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
832,42,So that's the route that the county appears close to selecting.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
833,42,"Next steps in this process would be to enter preliminary engineering and design, do the NEPA review, and then work to obtain a Federal Transit Administration grant for up to 80% of the cost of the project.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
834,42,Right now we're estimating that's about a $150 million project from a capital cost perspective.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
835,42,"Just briefly touching on other efforts, we continue to work with MMSD on flood modeling and floodplain mapping.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
836,42,"Specific within the city, the Menominee River watershed is about ready.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
837,42,"In fact, the DNR just approved the last piece, so we're all going to work together to work with FEMA on a letter of map revision to get updated Menominee River floodplains across the entire river watershed.",0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
838,42,We also worked closely with DPW and a number of other operators and other units of government across the Milwaukee urbanized area on distributing COVID-19 transit relief funds.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
839,42,There was about $216 million given to the Milwaukee urbanized area from the Federal Transit Administration by Congress during 2020 and early 2021 that goes towards supporting operations.,0,2021 Annual Report of Tax Incremental District Statistics
