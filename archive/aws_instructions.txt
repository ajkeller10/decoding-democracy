Instructions for activating aws resources

1. download access credentials in csv and save in secure location

2. in terminal type "aws configure" and be prepared to use credentials. Use us-east-1 and json format

3. create s3 bucket
aws s3api create-bucket --bucket decoding-democracy --region us-east-1

Alternatively, create bucket here: https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/buckets?region=us-east-1

Be prepared to delete after usage
aws s3api delete-bucket --bucket decoding-democracy

4. create boto3 client connection 
s3 = boto3.client('s3', aws_access_key_id=aws_access_key_id, aws_secret_access_key=aws_secret_access_key)

5. upload data to bucket
s3.upload_file('data_for_s3.pickle', 'decoding-democracy', 'unembedded.csv')


note: i got stuck on role permissions for creating
aws_lambda=boto3.client('lambda')
iam_client = boto3.client('iam')
role = iam_client.get_role(RoleName='decoding_democracy_lambda')
#check job definitions to make sure that the execution role was defined correctly



next steps
1) try not doing queue and just running lambda
2) log in and delete form olpinney2
